so now in this lecture we are going to discuss in further detail about fog computing architectureso in the previous introductory lecture on fog computing we have already seen the basicsof fog the whole premise under which fog operates and also the advantages of using fog computingso that we have already seen the advantages of using fog computing over the traditionalcloud computing and we have also seen that in iot it is essential to have ah ah a fogah platform ah in addition to the cloud platform so i should remain you over here that ah itis not like a a substitute it is not like fog is a substitute of cloud so that we shouldnot ah think that way so ah fog is something which is complementary it complements thecloud technology so we need both fog and cloud along with the iot devices and the architectureah along with the i iot architectureso so this is what we need so we need iot devices the protocols the architectures plusfog plus cloud ah to have a complete ah platform for ah for proper use so let us go throughthe details further so when we talk about the architecture of fog we have to keep inmind that the cloudservices are extended to iot services ah iot devices through fog sothis is what is happening so what is so essentially i i i should ah explain this thing ah ah ahina little bit ah different way so essentially earlier what was happening is we have thecloud and we have the iot devices iot devices sending the data to the cloud and then gettinga response back or getting ah ah getting the data back ah from the cloud if it is requiredfor further actuation of whatever details so this is the traditional way of dealingwith ah iot devices with only cloudnow what we are saying over here is we need to have some capabilities of cloud being implementedcloser to the iot devices layer so we we want essentially something like this so traditionallywe had cloud and now we are talking about a fog architecture in the cloud architecturewe have these different iot devices and data being sent and response received either responseor even the data can be fetched so this could represent even the data being fetched andso on and so forth right and here the cloud would take care of processing of the dataplus storing of the data so processing could even include things like running differentanalytics rightso this is the traditional model now the problem over here is that you know one very importantproblem is that the problem of latency that means that it takes so much of time for thedata that is sensed by this iot device to be uploaded to cloud doing some processingover there and then getting ah the response back so the overall ah over basically thisdelays the whole ah ah process so in fog actually what we are saying is we still will have thecloud we will have the fog layer here so this is cloud this is fog very closer to this devicesthe iot devices some are going to happen here and some of the processing and computationand getting some responses in the form of let us say triggers or actuation signals thosewould be sent to thecloud directly and some would be like in between in between meansthat like in some case we need to have computations only in that fog in some case you know somebasic processing will be done in the fog and the rest would be sent to the cloud and insome case we can send directly to the cloud without having the intermediate fogso we have two different comparable architectures of iot one using cloud the other using fogand the essence is that in fog we are not saying that we will get rid of cloud thisis you know we still have to go through a go ah ah by using cloud but in addition weare going to introduce a fog layer this fog layer is going to have something known asthe fog nodes we are going to talk about this fog nodes shortly and here we are going tohave these iot devices so this is the whole crux of fog computing and the next few slideswe are going to discuss in different ways the different aspects of fogso essentially what we are doing is we are trying to bring the cloud surfaces in theform of processing storage closer to the iot devices layer through the introduction offog so as i said fog is a layer which is between the cloud and the iot devices where many fognodes may be present and the sensor data are processed in the fog before it is sent tothe cloud and as i was telling you before that only those data where the data are timesensitive those would be processed in the fog there could be some otherdata which arenot time sensitive so those would be better processed in the cloud itselfso what we have basically is some kind of complementarity along with cloud by introductionof fog so what is the advantage number one reduction in latencyso the overall latencyfrom the point the sensing is done till the point processing and storage and further responseback is received at thesource so that latency is reduced can be reduced significantly withthe introduction of fog the second advantage is that because we are not flooding the entirenetwork with all these different sensed packets we are sharing bandwidth and also we are savingstorage at the cloud because not everything is sent to the cloudso let us look atthis figure we have already gone through it from a different perspectivein a different way so let us go through it so we have at the very bottom these iot deviceswhich are basically sort of like the physical layer of any network we have this physicaliot devices over here then we have this fog layer this is the fog layer and then we havethe cloud so iot devices layer fog layer and the cloud this fog layer has these fog nodeswhich are sort of like virtual instances of the iot devices these virtual instances aregoing to do are going to have better or improved processing capability improved ah storagecapabilities and so onthe fog layer i should mention over herehas some transient storage capabilities transientstorage so not like permanent storage so transient storage capabilities and permanent storageif required would be you know that kind of data would be sent to the cloud eventuallyso i should also mention over here another component that is very much important so thedata that is fetched over herecan we fetched from a private server or a cloud or the datacan be basically pushed into these devices or this platform the cloud platform the privatecloud platform to store the confidential data of the farm former any organization whichis basically adapting this technologynow the fog node that i just mentioned in the architecture in the previous slide hascertain specific characteristics number one is storage so the storage over here is transientnot permanent unlike in the case of cloud number two is the computing facility sowhichis about processing the databefore it is sent to the cloudand that basically helps in reducingthe timefor taking decisions not taking decisions but timefor executing the decisions so quickerdecision making and execution of the decisions because the processing is done close to theclose to the iot devices that means to the edge and that is why this reduction is goingto happen compare to the traditional cloudnetwork connectivity is another characteristic of the fog node where the iot devicesbasicallyconnect with each other and other fog nodes and cloud the iot devices in the iot deviceslayer they also connectby other fog nodes and the cloud so they can either connect directlyor by other fog nodes or by other cloud this fog nodes could be instances of routers embeddedservers switches video surveillingscameras etcetera which are deployable anywhereinsidethe network and each fog node has its own aggregate fog node so this aggregate fog nodeconcept i will explain to you shortlyso there are three types ofdata in any iot application some dataare very much time sensitiveso we cannot really hold on to the data for too long so it has to be processed immediatelyand so on so for example surveillance surveillance using cameras you know so it doesnt make senseifwe are acquiring the data and after three four seconds or maybe you know after severalminutes the decision about doing something at the ground is that information is sentto the iot device maybe some actuation or something something is sent to the iot devicesso it is ai mean surveillance is such an application where basically time is very critical andwe cannot delay to long less time sensitive data you know one is very time sensitive datalike the surveillance applications less time sensitive data for example some non criticalhealth care data is less time sensitive data and data of which are not time sensitive atall like you know the health care data but which does not concerned the life or deathof a patient sorry of a ah death of a patient not life but death of a patientso so so that kind of data is not time sensitive so fog nodes is work according to the typeof data they that they receive and the iot application should be installed in each fognode to handle this various types of data so let us look at this particular diagramwe have this iot devices and these devices basically sent the data the data are ingestedat the nearest fog node if it is time sensitive then some immediate action will be taken bythe fog node and that result is going to be communicated to the iotdevice thenits sendsthe summary of the historical analysis and storage which are not very time sensitiveto the cloud for longer term storage and processingnow if it is a non time sensitive data then these devices send the summary for historicalanalysis and storage to the cloud because it is not time sensitive now in the previousscenario if the data is relative less time sensitive then it is aggregated at the fognode and that aggregated data is sent as summary for historical analysis and storage to thecloud and some action is performed on the iot devices in the devices layerso this is the whole idea behind fog so remember one thing that when we are talking about fogwe are typically talking about low power resource constraint environments like iot environmentsiot environments directly with cloud nota good very not a very good solution as suchso we need faster processing faster reactivity and so on so that is the reason we need someprocessing some storage capabilities at the age that means closer to the iot devices sothat is where fog comes as a benefit to this iot technologyso the nearest fog node basically ingests the data from the devices and the most timesensitive data are the data which should be analyzed with in like fractions of a secondand the analysis should be done nearest to the node itself and the decision about whathas to be done after the analysis or the action that has to be taken based on the analysisis sent to the iot devices like an actuator or something and a copy of it is sent andstored at the cloud for longer term storage and analysis for less time sensitive datathe data of which can the less timesensitive data are the data which can be analyzed afterseconds or minutes and they are send to the aggregate node the aggregate fog node forthe analysis afteranalysis the aggregate node sends the decision or action to the devicethrough the nearest node and the aggregate node sends there is summary to cloud for storageand futureanalysis for non sense ah non time sensitive datawhich are basically data ofwhich can wait for hours days weeks and so on these kind of data are sent directly tothe cloud for storage and longer term analysis future analysis and the summaries from thefog nodes can be considered as less time sensitive data or even some kind of data from the fognodes from the iot devices can also be directly stored in the cloud and those are the oneswhere time is not an issue at allso this is the summary of what action has to be taken at the fog node so analysis durationfraction of a second fog nodeclosest to the devices does it seconds to minutesanalysisduration thefog aggregate node does it and hours to weeks the cloud does iot data storageduration is you knowin the fog node this storage is transient it is in the order of hours ordays for the aggregate nodes and months to years in the cloud for geographical coverageina fog node what are closest to the devices the coverage is very local it is wider coveredfor the aggregatenode the fogaggregate node and it is global for the cloudadvantages of fog security improved security faster processing low operation cost dataare processed in the fog nodes before sending to the cloud so that way the bandwidth isalso reduced bandwidth consumption is reduced and further the other important the most importantiwould think is that faster response time quickly ah the actions that are determine throughthe analysis can be executed ah in this kind of model that way the unwanted accidents thatare going to happen may be you know if the iot devices are implemented in some safetycritical platforms like you know industry so where there is industrial safety a primeconcernso in such case such a case it is required to process fast you now we cannot wait untilit is sent to the distant cloud for processing storage etcetera etcetera we have to do itclose to the point of sensing and that is where you know if you do that the processingtime reduces quite significantly the decision making is becomes very fast and the unwantedaccidents can be reduced in this particular using such a such an approach privacy everyindustry can analyze their own data locally and ah the the confidential data in this fogapproach can be stored locally in the local servers and only those data which can be sharedwith others which are not very confidential they can be sent to the cloudbusiness agility also improves so you know faster we can accept the customers needs andthose can be programmed very fast into the network and that way the costumers satisfactioncan be improved supporting nobilityhere in this fog model the nodes can be mobile andthe nodes can join and leave the network at any time a true feature of any pervasive computingsystem any ubiquitous mobile ubiquitous system this solution the fog platforms can be deployedin a remote places and they can be subjected to harsh environmental conditions becausetypically this is what happens like environmental monitoring open environment you know differenttypes of harsh environmental conditions snow fall rain fall hill storm etcetera etceteraso the so the devices the the fog technology asa whole will have to go through this kindof ah you know harsh environmental condition better data handling because ah you knowlessbandwidth will be consumed for handling the data data can be analyzed locally and thatwould reduce the risk of latency in terms of the applications of fog we can performreal timehealth analytics using fog technology where the patients with chronic illness canbe monitored in real time patients you know undergoing stroke you know are any kind ofmedical emergency you know so this particular technology is basically good for use in suchkind of situationsintelligent powers ah intelligence ah ah power efficiency intelligence and power efficiencyso fog is power efficient as we have seen before it reports the detailed power consumptionreport every day and suggest economical power usage plan a realtime real monitoring is anotherapplication where the railway tracks in real time can be monitored on a day to day basisin an ahah in an efficient manner so that is going to improve the overall safety andreliability of railway systems pipeline optimization so you know gas lines oil transportation linesare pretty common so real time monitoring of the pressure the flow the compressor ahyou know compressor is necessary in such kind of gas pipeline ah systemsso tera bytes of data are created and sending all these data to the cloud for analysis andstorage is not sufficient and fog becomes a solution in such a scenario because latencyto high latency is not very too much of high latency is not very acceptable in in suchcases because there could be pipe leakages gas leakages and so on and that is not a verygood thing to happen real time wind wind mill and turbine analysis wind direction and speedanalysis can increase the output data can be monitored in real time different challengeschallenges with respect to handling or consumption so additional nodesare used power consumptionis ah higher than ah the centralized cloud and these are low power devices we are talkingabout and everything is done at the cloud so that is the reason why power consumptionhasto be taken care of ah you know ah as a challenge in this kind of environmentdata security so handling data security is ah ah a crucial challenge in fog platformsthe data ahthat are generated are distributed so it provides authentication and authorizationsystemfor the whole nodes ah ah ah and that has to be doneah for fog platforms which is nota very easy task in terms of reliability maintaining data integrity and availability for millionsof nodes is difficult and the failure of a node cannot affect the network fault toleranceso if there is some fault with a particular node and that should be immediately fixedand this fixationshould happen ideally in an autonomous fashion so there should be autonomousfault tolerance fault detection also fault detection and tolerance and ah real time analysisreal time analysis is a primary requirement for minimizing latency dynamicanalysis anddecision making reduces the danger and increases the through putin terms of the programming architecture fog nodes may be mobile nodes can connect andleave the network whenever necessary and many data processing frameworks are statisticallyconfigured these frameworks cannot provide proper scalability and flexibility in conclusionfog is a perfect partner for cloud and iot it can sit in between iot and cloud to helpiot in the different functions ah that it hasto perform it solves the primary problemthat is faced by cloud with handling iot data it reduces it reduces the latency overalland that is one of the i would say that it is one of the most important benefits of theuse of the fog technologythe third is it benefits the benefits extends from an individual person to huge farms andso basically you know so this is a scalablearchitecture so its not like only a few people who wouldbe using it so the benefits can be extended to huge farms through the use of fog technologyand this fog technology basically provides a real time analysis and monitoring so theseare some of the references for you to go through further and if you are interested to understandfog and some of this contents have been taken from these references and the other referencesthat have been mentioned at the bottom of the slides ah in the in this particular lecturethank you
