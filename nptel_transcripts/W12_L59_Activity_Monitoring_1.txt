hello in this lecture ah this again will be a two part lecture on activity monitoringthe first part will focus on the basics of activity monitoring like what we are goingto do why is it required and what is the necessity for activity monitoring in day to day lifeor maybe in special scenarios and finally in the second part of this lecture which ismainly a case study will give a demonstration has small demonstration of a simple networkbased data aggregator which can be used for monitoring various activities so the datais being generated from a smartphone and being sent to a remote server over the network sowe have developed a small app which generates or captures the various human activities notactually activities it captures the various sensor behaviour during human activitiessuppose a person is walking running lying down is talking maybe person is fighting orhad an accident and so on and the sensor values keep on changing the specially the smartphonesensors since we are talking about or the case study we are talking about smartphonesensors so we have taken the inbuilt sensors in the smartphone so those sensorial valuesare transmitted over the network to remote server where they can be used for multitudeof applications ranging from normal activity monitoring fall detection you can even usea offline non smartphone sensor like a standard accelerometer or i m o based sensors integratedto a small processer board and the same operation can be performed for those sensors alsoso these things these non smartphone based activity monitors they have been given thecommon name wearables so you must have heard about wearables you have fitbits activitytrackers it it is in the form of a small watch inside it is thinner and tinier then a watchyou just charge it wear it and go about your daily activities so these are a few basicideas will be discussing in this case study so these wearable sensors have nowadays becomevery popular this has been due to multiple reasons first and foremost there very efficientsecond there low power consuming third they generate reliable data so that your activitiescan be accurately tracked so they have found many applications in various fields such asmedical field childcare elderly care entertainment industry security and so on so these sensorshelp in monitoring the physical activities of human and your physical activities notonly restricts to daily activities so people can say if your monitoring my activities youcan track what i am doing so i am not comfortable with sharing those kind of data over the networkso yes there are various issues regarding privacy regarding security of data but wewont be dealing with those issues here so one by one let us just go through the basicslike in medical childcare elderly care entertainment security even military what are the applicationswhat are the implications of using activity recognition so generally in medical fieldah imagine a patient is hospitalized and his or her activities need to be monitored supposeyou have a very fragile patient he needs to go to the washroom to relieve himself or herselfand while doing so the patient falls down so normally it may be a while before someonefinds that patient in a foreign state so to avoid this kind of injury or this durationafter falling down so this recovery duration can be massively reduced by using activitytrackers suppose the patients are made to wear bracelets embedded with small activitytrackers which are train to detect fall in patients or maybe they detect the changesin biomedical parameters like your pulse rate heartbeat and so on so these are now availablein the market and collectively their called wearables you have smart watches with activitytrackers you have standalone activity trackers and so onso in the medical field this can be very important for monitoring patients in child care if yourchild is playing on the streets if your child is going to school you can monitor your childsactivities if a if your child falls down or there has been accident automatically thesystem will alert the parent that child has met with an injury or an accident then aswe have covered earlier it for elderly care its almost the same as the medical usage ofwearables so imagine elderly people in your home wearing small activity trackers the bestpart is these are very small so people hardly notice there even there soan additionally they are not very power hungry so once in a while you charge it may be inthree days four days you charge it and it will keep on going so in elderly care youare you can use these activity monitoring applications in the entertainment industryyou must have seen various documentary documentaries or you must have seen those action movieswhere the protagonist performs multiple and dangerous stunts so you must have realizedmost of these are something which is known as c g i so in c g i actually you stand infront of a green screen wearing various activity monitors in front of cameras which are usedto track your activities and you have certain highlighted points or markers on your bodyand these will be used for generating what activity your performance and so that thiscan be reliably translated in terms of a movie scene with changing backgrounds maybe yousee some dinosaurs running around you after your c g i scripting and editing has beendone maybe your jumping of a bridge your jumping of a plane and so onso this is from the entertainment industry in security also you can have activity monitorsmonitoring where you are going what exactly you are doing maybe you have no person zoneand if someone is entering that zone or maybe have activity sensors installed which youdo not work in our area you do not want anyone to access and suddenly in the middle of thenight some of the sensors go off so you hit upon this idea that since no one is supposedto be in that area and suddenly many activity sensors are turning on so there may be a caseof breach of that security so this is maybe one of the potential applications of activitymonitors in the domain of security so now coming back to the i o t based scenariosthis activity monitor monitoring plays a very important role and since may if you keep thesecurity aspects the entertainment as pesticide normal medical and human implications in dayto day life they provide for a better quality of life they provide and the promise for abetter quality of life and this safeguard the humans against various accidents by promisingand providing quicker response quicker emergency action and other system now suppose whiledriving a person is wearing an activity monitor which normally under emergency normally alertssome emergency numbers as well as his family members so the person meets with an accidenton the road and there is a sudden change in the persons activity since let us supposethe person is only wearing an accelerometer on his rest and within normal limits the accelerometeris giving two units of reading and the impact of with the impact of the accident these twounits will be translated to hundred units so that would be a massive jump in the personsdaily activities so that means the person has received a big physical shop so that thesensor is giving such an abnormal reading so in this way you can train your system bothon the device as well as offline or online on the network to generate abnormal activitiessometimes it may be due to sensor malfunction sometimes it may be due to electrical disturbancebut sometimes it maybe even due to some serious life threatening situations so once this abnormalactivity has been registered maybe some emergency numbers are alot alerted family members arealerted and they are notified of the persons location the present location or the lastlocation from which the alert was generated and immediately rescue teams reach that personand eventually the person will survive may there are high chances that the personmay survive so another thing is to provide information accurately and in a very reliablemanner and you need to provide a continuous monitoring support while considering activitymonitor so typical architectures deal with suppose you have this person and he is equippedwith multiple wearables one is tracking the heartbeat one is tracking the body temperatureone is tracking the activity on the rest and all this data is being forwarded maybe toa remote router or a network server and then an analyzer analyses the activities and insteadof transmitting the raw data the analyzer transmits the analyzed activities to variousconnected stations that may be a home computer to which the family members are keeping trackof view that maybe a laptop or a mobile computer or even a cloud or maybe your medical doctorsor consultants are keeping track of your activities so this is a online base model maybe for offlinebased models you can have all these things on a single raise band in a small minute sizeand it is doing all the processing offline that is within the device itself so theremay be certain disadvantages of these and the applications may be restricted but yessuppose you are going for jogging and you can using these offline models like everycalculation and everything is being done on the device itself you can keep track of yourheart rate and it will give you an analysis whether you need to slow down or need to speededup during your jogging and there are multiple such applications of activity monitoring sothey inherently have certain advantages first is your continuous monitoring of activitywill result in daily observation of human behaviour and repetitive patterns and theactivities so prior to generalizing some activities yourwalking pattern your running pattern the where you said where you stand the your basic bodylanguage where is for every person so that may vary due to height that may vary due toweight that may vary due to some previous injury some present injury and there are multiplereasons while there may be variations so you need continuous monitoring and continuoustraining of the system to generate reliable results and this will also generate repetitivepattern suppose if you are going for normal activities like running walking jogging maybedriving sitting lying so they have clear cut markers they can be easily applied to butwhat if you have some special activities you need to take care of like when you are liftingyour left leg when you are lifting your right leg you need to distinguish between thesekind of minute activities you need to find you in your system in this can be only donethrough collection of data over a long period of time from individual subjectsnow another advantage is the easy integration of these sensors and the fast equip equippingtime of persons with these sensors then you have long term monitoring available sincethese are very low power consuming you can keep on monitoring the activities for daysat an end then using normal sensors and basic handle devices you can build up the systemwhich can monitor activities you can up for either smartphones or you can go for accelerometersattached to a basic processor and maybe a wifi radio or you can go for gyroscopes whichgives the orientation readings you have g p s and you can have multiple sensors youcan keep on increasing the sensors but at the end the more the sensors you are increasingthe more power hungry your device becomes the more costly your device becomes and morevolume of data it will generate so these are some of the plus and minus pointsof using activity monitoring using sensors so mainly you need to restrict the numberof sensors you go on including on a variable so that it is lightweight it is portable andit is less power hungry so some of the basic human activities which these market availabledevices do are they can distinguish actions they can distinguish gestures like for actionsthey can distinguish between running jumping or whether a person is lying down or sittingand what gestures you can have if a person is holding his or her legs if a person ismoving his or her hands and suppose if a person is dancing right so that would be consideredas an action but there will be gestures involved also so maybe a person is dancing peacefullyor a person is dancing aggressively you can detect that using various gestures you candetect you can maybe predict the intent of a person using the gestures the person isproviding maybe a person is threatening someone maybe a person is trying to please someoneand so on so some basic sensors you have you can eithergo for video or image based monitoring of activities which is very processing intensivethen you can go for smartphone based activity monitors you can involve a lot of sensorsinbuilt sensors but your phone has to generate a lot of data and then again you have thisnormal activity tracker band where the sensors unlimited and power is quite restricted soonce your data is collected from the sensors be at the camera be at the smartphone sensorsbe at normal stand alone sensors what next you have to find some means or methods toanalyze these data generally these data are going to be very long there will be errorsor let us say in statistical terms there will be outlets that may be due to errors in thesensor reading that may be due to fluctuation in the sensor itself that may be due to someaccidental minor accidental bumping of the sensor suppose you are about to wear youractivity tracker band and suddenly it falls off on the groundthe person is standing still the person is fine but the sensor falls off so that willrecord a major shock other alert in the activity monitoring system so these kind of falls predictionscan be avoided and we will name them as out layers that is beyond the normal statisticalbehaviour of the data so you have statistical analysis of the data being generated generallythey work on sensor data then you have machine learning based analysis again they work onsensor data maybe machine learning with image processing you can use for analyzing videoand image data then you have this deep learning based approaches you can use normal sensordata you can use image data you can also go for video based dataso somewhere sometime in the previous slides i have already discussed it but mainly youractivity monitoring can be divided into two parts one is in place the other is networkbase so i am calling the activity monitoring or the processing of data on the device itselfas an in place approach so your monitoring is done on the device since you are monitoringyour diagnosing the activities on the device itself will need a processor the processorhas to process the sensor data and has to generate some alert so it is definitely goingto be power hungry or power intensive and generally no network connection is requiredbut yes you can obviously opt for network connections so even if you go for networkbased in place devices there will be an unnecessary wastage of additional powernext is your network based system so these are mainly aimed at processing larger andprocessing intensive methods such as deep learning tasks computer vision based taskmachine learning based task and so on ah group based analytics is possible suppose you andyour group of twenty friends are out on a hike maybe on the hillside or somewhere ofterrain so suddenly one or two members start lagging behind so since you are not awarein that rough terrain since you are yourself very tired but you are not aware about yourfriends position so your activity tracker will tell your group that you are group ismoving at this average velocity whereas two units or two persons from this group are laggingbehind so maybe they are facing some heart shapes or they are maybe facing some medicalcondition and need to be looked into so we call this group based analytics so inthis one network based approach you can go for group based analytics then obviously mostof the processing and data is off loaded to a server and only you have a wireless radioand a sensor on your body so this will be low power consuming and additional you willrequired and average to good network connection maintain with the server to which you aresending your data for activity monitoring so those are different approaches so i hopefor this case study the basic importance of activity monitoring has been established inthe next part will give a demonstration of how we are using smartphone base sensors andconnecting it to a network and visualizing it okthank you
