now we start a new lecture which is on connected vehicles so connected vehicles has becomevery popular in the recent years there is a lot of research that is going on on buildingconnected vehicles for good reasons what are these these different reasons so stand alonevehicles embedded with embedded with different sensors has been there since several yearsnow if not decades so you know these standalone different vehicles you know we all are usingdifferent vehicles and these have different embedded sensors embedded systems and so onbut in connected vehicles actually we are talking about how we can make communicationbetween different vehicles possible so what kind of communications communication betweena vehicle one vehicle with another vehicle communication between a vehicle and a pedestrianuser or another user who is not there in the vehicle vehicle and the roadside infrastructureor the existing infrastructure in a city so all of these different possibilities are therein a connected vehicle so let us look at this particular exampleso let us say that we have so we are talking about a scenario to motivate why connectedvehicle connected vehicles are required so let us say that we have these different vehicleson the road so in a every vehicle has its own different sensors and it can even be feededwith more sensors more communication equipment and so on even further it can be done so ifwe talk about a single vehicle in a connected vehicle scenario these vehicle could be talkingto the immediate next vehicle the neighbor vehicle this vehicle could be talking to thisone may be with the either directly or with the help of some intermediate vehicle whichis there in its neighborhood this vehicle could be talking to a roadside person youknow so this connection flow you know this communication flow might be possible or therecould be these different existing communication infrastructure with which this informationexchange may also happen so you can have v two i v two v vehicle toinfrastructure vehicle to vehicle communication vehicle to human or even human to vehicleand when we are talking about human we are talking about the humans who are not in thevehicle who are on the road side so all these things are made possible in the connectedvehicles and there is lot of you know if we look at the history there has been lot ofyou know at least a a decade or decade and a half there has been lot of research on vehicularcommunication and intelligent transportation systems vehicular ad hoc networks vanets vehicularsensor networks then came this connected vehicles then came the you know intelligent connectedvehicles all of these you know in different forms have been around but the different servicesthis different service improvements that can be made possible in people are talking aboutin the context of connected vehicles and you know ah and ah this intelligent connectedvehiclesso let us look at some of this basics which will help in building this connected vehiclesso in connected vehicles we have the vehicles that are equipped with different sensors networkingand communication infrastructure different devices or by you know intra vehicle communicationso so remember one thing couple of things you know so what is going to happen is ina connected vehicles scenario number one it would be possible to communicate with thedifferent devices inside a single vehicle number one number two is between differentvehicles from a vehicle to the roadside infrastructure or a fixed infrastructure that means a nonmobile infrastructure so all these different types of communicationare going to happen in a connected vehicles scenario so issues such as security privaciesscalability reliability quality of service and on top the lack of any singular globalstandard for connectivity are some of the challenges that are facing the building ofconnected vehicles so if you are interested you know so this particular paper that isreference over here prove a concept of home iot connected vehicles this paper you cango through this basically gives a good account of the different issues surrounding buildingof connected vehicles at present so this is a recent paper that was publishedin two thousand seventeen in the sensors journal so the different challenges for example securitysecurity is very important because you know so you are opening up with the help of wirelessand with the help of these different vehicles plying all around in the city yes you areopening up to lot of vulnerabilities at their your opening up you adding to the vulnerabilitiesand additionally privacy is also very important because the vehicular data plying all acrossdifferent people can get ah you know access to that dataso privacy of the data from different vehicles is very important you know why privacy isimportant let us say that if the data is leaked for one reason or another let us say thatthere is someone so i am i am driving and i am in a connected vehicle kind of environmentand from my vehicle the data is sent to another vehicle which is a trusted one by me but inbetween the data is leaked and that data is made accessible to somebody else so in thatcase what is going to happen is the the ah ah the the intruder or the malicious ah personor the entity which gets access to this data which was not intended for itso if that entity gets access to the data they will know that where i am going to fora for example where this vehicle is going to and that could be risky that could be evena security threat a safety threat ah because you know not only safety threat or securitythreat to the vehicle itself but also to the people who are inside like for example ifi am the user of the car if i am the driver of the car and if somebody gets access tothis kind of information even my safety my security is also at riskscalability is a huge huge challenge you are talking about an environment where there islot of mobility large number of devices coming in going out of the cities and you have tohave some kind of a registry about who are the home users home vehicles who are whichvehicles are the foreign vehicles and some kind of pricings some kind of keeping trackof all these mobility etcetera etcetera yes these are going to be there and at any timeanybody from outside can be coming into the cities people can we know the vehicles canbe going out of the city and you know its a highly highly challenging scenario so lotof issues of scalability you know more vehicles being added large number of vehicles beingadded at at in peak hours it will large large number of vehicles could be addedso scalability issues are there upscale even downscaling also you know if you think itwill be deep you will be able to understand that downscaling issues are also there thenyou have the reliability issues ah with respect to the reliable communication being ah possiblein this kind of environment quality of service lack of global standards so in a connectedvehicle connected vehicles are very good as we have seen there are lot of different interestinguse cases usefulness of connected vehicles then we have the vehicular cloud in a vehicularcloud what is going to happen is these connected vehicles are going to send all these datathese data are going to go to the cloud from the cloud lot of you know analytics are goingto be performed are you know the data the [analtics/analytics] analytics data are goingto made available to the respective stake holders and so onso all these connected vehicles is part you can conceptualize connected vehicles in aas part of ah the vehicular cloud and vehicular cloud and connected vehicles as part of theiot so these are like enablers of internet of things so the different users and the stakeholders of connected vehicles include academia law enforcement bodies like police ah youknow judiciary etcetera law enforcement bodies automobile companies government agencies standardizationgroups cloud service providers so these are the different stakeholders different actorsof connected vehicles so typically in a connected vehicle the mostpopular concept is the concept of vehicle to everything paradigm so v two x vehicleto everything v two x so v to x is basically part of the future its intelligent transportationsystem which enables vehicles to wirelessly share a diverse range of information and theinformation sharing may be with other vehicles pedestrians or fixed infrastructures suchas mobile towers parking meters and so on so this is what at the very outset of thisparticular lecture i was also telling you that this vehicle can communicate with thepedestrians on the way with the other vehicles on the road or with fixed infrastructuressuch as mobile towers or parking meters and so onso this basically allows for graphic management ensuring on road and off road safety mobilityfor travelling and so on so i do not need to elaborate on these but this is quite evidentand understandable ah ah the ah you know ah how this v two x is going to be useful v twox basically follows a distributed architecture where the contents are widely distributedover the network so content based communication so i will talk about that its a content contentcentric v two x basically uses content centric and not really the tcp ip kind of you knowinformation dissemination approach it is not restricted to single source information providerit is designed mainly for highly mobile environments and vehicular environments are highly mobileenvironments it is designed mainly for such kind of environments the vehicles can shareinformation to notes in the vicinity as well as to remotely located notesso here ah you know v two x has greatly enhanced the travel efficiency the safety securityand so on the network in v to x is mainly used as a tool for sharing and disseminationof information and that is not something very new because ultimately what is going to happenis after this information is collected from these different sensors if the disseminationhas to happen with some communication medium and typically its a wireless communicationmedium where there is a network and the network basically helps in the dissemination of informationnow what do we already have in terms of implementation of v to x we already have our internet internetruns on tcp ip so you know if we try to implement v two x on top of tcp ip this is what is goingto happen so you know it is going to fail why so tcp ip is designed mainly for handlinginformation between single pair of entities there is a source there is a destination youknow and between these source and destination whether they are you know in direct rangeof each other or they are far apart tcp ip will have different solutions by which tosend the data from one point to another so the location the information exchange intcp ip is dependent on the location of data so you know there is a specific data baselocated at some place so from that point the data has to be fetched so from this particulardata base in a particular server the data has to be fetched so this is like dependenton the location of the data can only identify tcp ip can only identify the address of theendpoints which alone is not useful for content distribution and that that content distributionis what is required in the cases of connected vehicles in v to x and there is increase inthe number of wireless devices which basically restricts the mobility of the different nodesin content centric networking you know it is basically conceptually has similaritiesto the popular information centric networking which focuses on the data than the actuallocation of the data so i need some data i do not have to say that you know i have toget it from this particular database or this particular source in content centric networkingwhat is going to happen is if i need access to a particular data i will be doing somekind of a broadcasting some kind of broadcasting of that particular requirement that queryand whoever has that data is going to send me the data so this is how the content centricnetworking contrast to tcp ip functions so we have hierarchically name data in contentcentric network hierarchically named data is something like x dot y dot z you know thiskind of hierarchy is followed ok something like you know my data would be something likemister dot sudeep dot age dot something so it is hierarchically named you know very similari am giving you just an analogous example not the exact one so hierarchical data istransmitted directly instead of being part of the conversation so the conversation wouldbe like the entire thing this dot this dot this dot this that becomes the entire entireconversation so so this is the how the hierarchical datais organized so i do not need to really if i need to get access to a particular partof that hierarchical data i dont need to access the entire conversation i can simply pickup from that particular part so it enables scalable and efficient data disseminationin network caching allows for low data traffic it works well in highly mobile environmentsso in highly mobile environments you do not really need to keep track of the source thedestination and the intermediate hops in between and how the data is going to float all aroundso you have a highly ad hoc kind of scenario and content centric networking i basicallythe following this kind of philosophy that i just explained is very much useful so weare talking about vehicular ad hoc networks which is based on dedicated short range communicationdsrc and the wave protocol which is wireless access in vehicular environments the waveprotocol so these are the two ah you know very ah wellknown protocols that are used in vehicular ad hoc network the dsrc protocol and the waveprotocol so routing protocols are derived from the manets and but here actually youhave different types of characteristics than manets you know it is a derivation all theserouting protocols for manets are basically derivations ah over ah from from manets butagain they are different by taking the the typical features of vehicular networks howthe vehicles fly ah ply on the road on highways and so on are taking in account and how theycommunicate with the roadside infrastructure these are actually taken into accountso high through put is achievable in mobile environments using vanets and also low latencycan be guaranteed in mobile environments in vanets vanet basically has different featuresit has a highly dynamic topology where the vehicle vehicles are highly mobile and ahthey are changing their position and the network topologies come continuously the brake andthey make continuously so you have a highly dynamic breaking making kind of topology whichis done continuously so high transmission and computation capabilitythe vehicles store energy sources ah sorry the vehicles ah vehicles stored energy sourcesand the computational sources are used to draw power and that basically is much highercompared to the stand alone iot devices and that is why there is no not much restrictionthere is not much of ah you know restriction on the energy source ah energy use and computationalpower and so on because the vehicular ah you know energy sources and the computationalenergy sources in the vehicles these are quite highunstable connectivity in vanets link durations are short due to high dynamic feature of ahthe these networks ah these networks can be scaled up very easily to include differentother vehicles on the road they can join these particular network without effecting the throughputin a very significant manner ah the predictable mobility patterns can be ah ah can be achievedin these kind of networks because the vehicles are restricted with in the roads you knowhow the road structure is and that basically restricts the mobility pattern also and thesemobility patterns are predictable in these kind of networks in contrary in manets basicallyin mobile ad hoc networks the mobility is a big issue you do not know you know how thevehicles are going to move it is hard to predict the mobility of these different vehicles safetyissues are there emergency breaking lenge sorry lane change warning ah you know collisionavoidance hazard notification these are the different safety applications of vanets efficiencyah with respect to congestion management electronic toll collection parking availability theseare again different attractive applications of vanetsthird type of applications are commercial applications for example ah making a havinginternet access multimedia streaming all these possible ah on the road when you are ah onthe road in the car in the vehicle so these are possible in vanets then different othercomfort comforts with respect to getting whether information autonomous driving journey timeestimation these are all made possible with the help of implementation of vanets thenah ccn the content centric networking that was telling you before how it is implementedin vanets so some sort of routing is done but this kindof routing is bit different so forwarding and routing is best here on name of the contentnot the location of the content the name of the content is used for routing the individualcontents name prefixes are advertised by the routers across the network these helps tobuild a forwarding information base for each router the name of the content remains thesame and unique globally and there is no issue of ip address management or address exhaustionthe communication does not depend on the speed or direction of the different nodesso these are the different issues so the main thing that he have to has to be rememberedis there is indeed the same way as we have routing tables in the case of tcp ip basedrouting here we also have a very similar kind of thing which we have the forwarding informationbase at each of these different routers but here the routing is done not on the basisof the location of the content but on the basis of the name of the contents so wherethis and that name has to be unique so this is very important if the name is not uniquethen this kind of routing cannot be done so in content centric routing the name also hasto be unique in the network scalability and in networking caching mechanismat each outer is implemented which uniquely identifies the named data chunks and thesedata chunks are stored in something known as the content store which acts as a cashsubsequent requests for a stored data chuck can be made to a ah a to a content store thenaming system in the content store enables a data to be used multiple times unlike inthe case of normal ip based routers as we discuss before and the there is reduced networkload during the increase network size as a result of the caching mechanismnow will talk about a very interesting architecture which is called the body and brain architecturethat has been proposed for the connected vehicles so it is an in vehicle networking architecturewhich has very similar kind of ah you know architecture as the human body as in the humanbody we have the body the code body having the skeleton the muscles the ah you know tissuesthe organs and and and ah this ah you know so that kind of ah structure but on top youwe also have the nervous system the brain etcetera and ah you know similar kind of thingis done in this case as well so here we have a three layered architecturethere is that sense and execution layer then we have the network and transmission layerand then we have the decision layer so the sense and execution layer is very similarto the body of a human body the network and transmission layer is very similar to thenervous system of the human body and the decision layer is very ah very similar to the brainof the human body so there are three layers the body consists of intelligent networkingnodes which constantly collect information from the vehicle and the then the brain basicallymanages the central coordination so let us first look at the sense and executionlayer in the sense and execution layer we have these intelligent nodes with the helpof sensors actuators different radios the information is acquired with the help of differentother devices like ladar radar proximity sensors and different other sensors plus actuatorssuch as steering brakes lights etcetera the information is acquired and the commands areexecuted through the ah through the actuators or through the different radio ah ah mechanismsthese are made available and this is how the sense and execution layer looks like in aconnected vehicle scenario the intelligent networking nodes which has intelligence withimplemented with the help of software ah ah you know different software there are thereare different types of nodes one is the registered type nodes which can be opened or closed thereis a motor type nodes which basically are you know the motors can be moving clock wisecounter clockwise or the motor can be stopped switch type nodes switches can be of differenttypes in a intelligent ah net ah node in a intelligent vehicle a it could be the switchescould be a nob ah a pneumatic switch or an electromagnetic switch the sensors could berheostatic switch ah rheostatic sensors rheostats we already know what a rheostat is so rheostaticsensors or transformers or transducers or they could be assembled ah nodes ah comprisingof different separate electronic controls the network and transmission layer looks likethis so you know this is basically ah you know this network and transmission layer andas this name suggest we have ah for communication this is used primarily for communication thesense and execution layer on the very bottom and on the top we have the decision layerand in between we have this communication in ah communication layer where there is ain vehicle bus system bus means that its a collection of ware so we have the in bus ahin vehicle ah ah you know bus system and ah ah so and there are different ah you knowproprietary and to open source components ah for communications so all these togetherwill comprise the network and transmission layer which is used for communication andthat basically sits in between the sensing and execution layer and the decision layerthat we talk about now in the decision layer which sits on top ofthe network and transmission layer the information is transmitted for monitoring to the administrativenode and for control of the sensor nodes the supervisory node basically sends the commandah ah ah to the network ah and the transmission layer for further sending to the actuatorsunderneath so with this we come to an end of this particular lecture ah of connectedvehicles we have talked about ah the first part of the connected vehicles the differentissues with connected vehicles why connected vehicles are very important and the differentassociated terminologies for example vehicular communication ah we also spoke about differentother allied terms such as vehicular ad hoc networks vehicular sensor networks ah thenintelligent ah intelligent vehicular systems ah ah then ah internet ah sorry connectedvehicles and ah intelligent connected vehicles icvs so these are the different things thatwe spoke about in the next lecture we will talk about few other different issues withconnected vehicles and how those issues can be resolvedthank you
