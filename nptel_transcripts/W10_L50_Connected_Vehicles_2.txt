so now we are going to continue with our discussion about connected vehicles in the second partof the lecture on connected vehicles we are going to talk about the intelligent connectedvehicles so intelligence means that it comes with lot of implementation of different typesof software different things can be performed intelligently different inferences predictionsetcetera etcetera based on the data that is obtained either from the hardware that isembedded or from the historical data that is collected ah from the ah from from thesite from the different vehicles on the site and what people have ah ah you know ah sendthe different vehicles have sent in the pastso based on that historical ah data different types of inferences can be done so that intelligentdecision making can be ah can be done so with the so here basically you know when we aretalking about intelligence of any kind we are talking about the use of software so intelligentsoftware the software basically uses different types of analytics different types of machinelearning ah methodologies ah and ah ah so these that will be applicable on top of thedata that is collected and the data thats collected is from the different sensors andthese sensors the actuators and so on get together are the down devices the base devicesthe physical devices which basically help in the procurement of this informationso let us consider a particular scenario like this for ah intelligent connected vehicleslet us consider two scenarios in the first scenario we have a road on which there isa vehicle and all these different vehicles are also moving on the road and then thereis a passerby so all these different vehicles and we are considering a very simple configurationlike this so what happens is when this vehicle these vehicles are moving on the road andlet us say that this is the lane and there is a vehicle which is trying to pass thisparticular vehicle so you know it might be possible to come up with a scheme throughwhich cooperatively these vehicles will help each other so that there is no collision betweenthemso there has these these has to be made possible with the help of enforcement of or enforcementor implementation of some scheme ah which is based on cooperation between the differententities cooperation between the different entities so in this particular example wewere talking about this vehicle this vehicle and this vehicle cooperating with each otherin order to avoid collision and that would be made possible with the help of the datathat is collected from the individual sensors in these different vehicles from the fromthe information that is obtained from the different roadside units from the differentlet me denote the road side units as solid blocksso from these from from this data from this data this data and also the data like thisso all these information would be collected together there would be some kind of a cooperationenforcement scheme may be using cooperative game theoretic approaches or something likethat two come up with schemes or to come up with decisions on driving so that these vehiclescan can keep safe distance from each other and they do not collide so this is one scenarioanother one could be let us consider another example where we have let us say it is nota highway but ah you know it is a city intersection like this and typically as you know that inthe intersections you have different ah blind spots maybe due to different buildings inthe corners or maybe there is a parked let us say that here we we have you know theseare the different buildings in the corners of an intersection or maybe there is someparked vehicle over here these are the different parked vehiclesso what might so happen is these vehicles these parked vehicles they often create blindspots blind spots and due to blind spots what might happen is a vehicle that is coming fromthis place and if they want to turn this way and another vehicle that is coming from thisway they might collide because these vehicle cannot see this one this one cannot see theseand they might collide so similar kind of other types of scenarios can also be ah youknow thought of thought of ah involving blind spots and so how do we avoid these thingso here also these might happen is again there is collision due to blind spots and intelligentconnected vehicles can help in this scenario as well so these can cooperate so there othervehicles that are there and the sensors in them like in the case of this particular scenariothey all can cooperate with one another in order to help these two vehicles so that theydo not collide with each other so we have one scenario of icv and the other scenarioof icv intelligent connected vehicles so let us look ahead and see what is there for usfurther so when we talk about intelligent connected vehicles we are talking about intelligenttransportation which we have already discussed the different transport infrastructure thecommunication channel pedestrians all coming together interconnecting them in an intelligentfashion to fulfill certain objectives ah the different use casesso let us look at some technological background about icv so the us department of transportand federal communications commission allocated seventy five megahertz in the band five eightfive zero two five nine two two five megahertz so this seventy five megahertz band as thededicated spectrum for internet intelligent connected vehicles so us has already doneit i for icvs they have a separate allocated seventy five megahertz band and these particularthing for icvs it is supported by the dsrc technology that we spoke about in the firstpart of intelligent ah of ah the connected vehicles lectureso in the first part we talked about the two types one is the dsrc communication technologythe other one is the wave communication technology so basically ah for this part basically ahthe seventy five megahertz communication ah for icvs ah there is that dsrc that is commonlyused and i triple e concurrently has also come up with this protocol eight zero twopoint eleven p and the i tripe eight i triple one six zero nine ah as two different standardsfor dsrc implementation so two different standards one is eight zero two point eleven p not thesimple not the standalone eight zero two point eleven protocol the standard so p the elevenp and sixteen point sorry sixteen zero nine i triple e standards are also used for icvimplementations and the society of automotive engineers came up with the sae j two seventhree five and j two nine four five two different standards by this particular societyso sixteen zero nine is for automotive connections automotive connections interconnected vehiclesso these standard and the different drafts i am going to go through so p sixteen zeronine dot zero this is a draft standard for wave architecture and this wave architecturei already told you before wave protocol so the wave architecture is basically draftedin this particular ah a in this particular document the p sixteen zero nine draft thenthe sixteen zero nine dot one two thousand six these basically takes about the trailuse standard for wave from a resource manager point of view dot two two thousand six isthe trail use standard for wave with security services for applications and management ofmessages dot three two thousand seven is the trial use standard for wave consisting ofdifferent networking services dot four two thousand six is the trail use standard forwave with multichannel operations and p sixteen zero nine dot eleven is over the year dataexchange protocol for standard transportation systems for for intelligent transportationsystems the itsso dsrc protocol if you look at it looks like this as shown in this particular figure wehave at the very bottom the bottom layer is not just the physical so it includes the eightzero two point eleven physical and the mac of eight zero two point eleven p these twoare at the very bottom then we have the sixteen zero nine point four which is the dsrc wavemac and then on top we have the dsrc wave short range messaging protocol sixteen zeronine dot three and also the regular ipv six and tcp ip ah tcp udp as the transport andthe different applications such as safety messaging general services etcetera on thevery top the security is something that cuts across vertically across all these differentlayers so security is drafted in point two i triple e sixteen zero nine dot twonow the phases of internet sorry intelligent connected vehicle development in phase oneit was considered to have you know facilities for infotainment service availability withremote information processing and that was based on the two g three g technology phasetwo basically included four g lte or dsrc and here the focus was on intelligent transportationservice and phase three basically was to connect all these vehicles to the cloud that was thephase three now let us look at some icve scenarios forwardcollision warning scenario so we have these different vehicles which are running on theroad we have this vehicle and these three different vehicles and this particular vehicleso they all would be you know having this information with respect to the speed thedirection the breaking status and so on and based on these they can cooperatively estimatethe collision course you know so that they do not collide with each other then this isan example of the existence of blind spot across you know blind spots on the roadso ah you know in particularly blind spots exist in the corner as i was telling you atthe very outset for a different kind of scenario so it might so happen that a particular vehiclewould be coming when there is a human who is trying to pass so this vehicle was supposedto come this way this human was supposed to walk on the ah you know on on on these pedestrianroad so when they try to cross there could be a possibility of crash crash between thevehicle and the human who is trying to cross because and this is this was happening becausethey were not within line of sight of each other and because of the existence of thisparticular building on the house on the corner so you know so taking care of this kind ofscenarios these v two p scenarios vulnerable road user safety scenarios was something thatwas considered in the intelligent connected vehicles vehicular ad hoc network is at thecore of icvs so when we talk about vehicular ad hoc networks we are talking about threedifferent types of communications at least number one communication inside the vehicleinside every vehicle there are lot of sensors there are lot actuators there are differenttypes of other embedded devices there are these different transmitters receivers andso on so in vehicle communication is one then comesthe ad hoc communication ad hoc communication is with without the help of any infrastructurethese vehicles would be able to communicate with one another so vehicle to vehicle communicationmay be directly or via some intermediate vehicle which will act as a relay of the messagesso vehicle to vehicle communication either directly or through relays and the infrastructurebased communication may be with the help of road side units or mobile towers and so onso these are the three different domains of vehicular communication in vehicle communicationad hoc communication and infrastructure based communication so in vehicle communicationfor that there are different obus the on board units that are basically fixed on the vehiclesso these vehicles they have each of these vehicles they have one or more obus the onboard units they also have something known as the a dash unit advanced driver assistantsystem unit which has different sensors such as cameras proximity sensors engine sensorsactuators radars and so on the communication is mainly through controller area networkvehicular power line network and the ethernet so these are three typical typically usedcommunication equipments communication facilities communication networks that are usedso what we have is something like this this is the whole vehicle this is the whole vehicleand in the vehicle we have these obus the onboard units the a dash comprising of differentsensors engine sensors brakes lighting radars proximity sensors and cameras and these areall connected with each other with the help of different communication technologies likecontroller area network vpln and ethernet in the ad hoc domain again we have these obusbut we are considering obus which are mobile and these vehicles basically can talk to eachother and also with the road side units the rsus but these road side units are consideredto be static in this particular architecture so the communication mode may be either vto v or v to i and the communication is done through the dsrc stack using the eight zerotwo point eleven p i triple e standard so let us considere this particular scenarioof these vehicles moving on the roads so each of these vehicles they have their own differentobu like this every vehicle has one or more obus and these rsus road road side units andit is possible to have different types of communication either vehicle to vehicle communicationlike this or from vehicle to rsu communication vehicle to rsu communication so this is vto v and this is v to i vehicle to infras[tructure]- because rsus are fixed infrastructure on theroad sides so that is the reason this is known as v toi infrastructure and it is also considered in the case of vanets in the case of intelligentconnected vehicles is that these rsus are connected to the internet rsus the road sideunits are also connected to the internet so basically the rsus have the internet connectivityand this is how this internet connectivity is used is ah provided to these differentvehicles on the road in the infrastructure domain the rsus basically are connected tointernet by means of gate ways in the presence of the rsus the vehicles may communicate tothe internet via v two i interfaces so when the rsus are present it is going to be thevehicles are communicating ah to the internet via the v two i interfaces whereas when thersus are not present the vehicles communicate with each other or the internet through cellularsuch as three g four g lte so these are the two scenarios that are depictedover here that i just mentioned here is a scenario of the rsu being present and whenthe rsu is present you know so rsu has the internet connectivity via the gateway andthat internet connectivity basically helps to have v two i and v two v communicationand this is the scenario of the rsu being absent and here basically you know if thersu is absent what is suggested is to take help of the existing infrastructure of cellularcommunication like three four g etcetera and with the help of three of four g lte you knowthese vehicles they would be able to communicate with each othernow what are the advantages of v two x communication so we remember in the last ah lecture previouslecture we spoke about the v two x that means vehicle to everything vehicle to anythingbasically communication what are the advantages it number one increases the traffic safetyincreases the driver safety optimizes the time of travel because you know if you ifeverything is connected together you can calculate your systems onboard systems can calculatethat from one point two another what is the optimized time of travel what are the differentah you know possibilities for different roots etcetera and how the travel can be made andthe efficiency of fuel consumption and secure travel security secure you know so becauseyou know its all connected together and you know you can secure you know you you knowthat what is the way to travel from a point a to point b in a secured manner fuel consumptionlikewise can be ah you know reduced so efficient fuel consumption easier drive in low visibilityor unfavorable weather conditions the disadvantages include isolation of privacyloss of data control collection of personal data secondary use of data secondary use ofdata is interesting secondary use of data means these data that is floating all acrossyou know so what is going to happen to it who is going to use it you know so whetherthere would be a non intended use of the data so secondary use of the data data use by unauthorizedentities very similar and tracking of movements of the vehicles is made possibleso you know it is possible that ah you know one can get ah all these different vehicleswho are connected together through that if there is some kind of a security leak or somethinglike that the positions and the movement patterns and futuristic predictions of about thesevehicles can be made and these you know so that basically is not a very good thing ifthere are some vulnerabilities that are there tracking of the movements and localizationof the positions of these different vehicles are the other disadvantagesso with this we come to an end of the second lecture on connected vehicles in fact we havespoken about connected vehicles in the first lecture and the second lecture as well wehave seen the different different advantages and disadvantages of connected vehicles intelligentconnected vehicles the different architectures the different standards that can be used andthe only thing that is required is from understanding about one of these things and whatever weunderstood as part of the module one and module two as well implementing those and comingup with a platform to enable this kind of architecturethank you
