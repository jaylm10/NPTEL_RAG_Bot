having gone through the different concepts of iot the basic concepts the networking conceptsthe communication concepts the connectivity establishment concepts the practical handson on iot in the previous lecture we will now go through a case study of how iot hasbeen used and this particular case study is on agricultural use so agricultural use ofiot more specifically on use of iot for smart irrigation and this is basically based ona project that i have executed along with my colleague professor n s raghuwanshi fromthe department of agriculture and food engineering of our institute iit kharagpur and here iam going to show you how iot can come as an help for as as help for ah building systemsthat can make irrigation smarter so it is a smart irrigation management systemthe system that we have developed the name is agrisens agrisens system and this is accessiblethis particular system is accessible publicly through the url agri sys a g r i s y s dotiit kgp dot ac dot in so let us look at some of these different aspects of this particularsystem so before we go further i would like to show you a hypothetical scenario throughthis particular figure so what is going to happen the use of iot in agriculture whatis going to happen in the future so the picture that we see in front of us is an agriculturalfield a hypothetical one where there are different types of sensors that are planted sensor suchas for soil moisture and water level monitoring for automated irrigation performance performingautomated irrigation automated recycling of organic waste vermicompostingautomated sowing and weeding and so and so forth so many different things automated systemsfitted with sensors fitted with different actuators these are going to be used for makingagriculture smarter so we in this particular project in the agrisens ah ah system we havedeveloped the system with a focus on water management using iot smart water managementso how do we do it so the objectives of this smart water management system the agrisenssystem are that how less water can be used for getting more yield in in terms of cropproductivity that means and typically you know so what happens is for plants such asrice that means paddy plants wheat and so on these basically are dependent on the soilmoisture the water level in the soil and so on and so forth and many other climatic factorsso the whole objective is that how can we monitor the soil conditions how much is themoisture content of the soil how much is the the water level the stagnant water level particularlythat is useful information for paddy crops paddy plants and how we can automate the irrigationprocess whenever the soil becomes dryer so if it becomes dryer below a certain thresholdlevel how to automate this particular thing so automated irrigation how do we performwith the help of this these different sensors so what we do is that based on these differentsensed information through the soil moisture sensors water level sensors from the fieldwe learn certain analytics based on the data that is received and then if the if if itis found out by the system autonomously by the system without any human interferenceif it is found out by the system that the water level has gone down or the soil moisturelevel has gone down or those are all climatic conditions are no longer prevailing then totake some actions the actions can be in terms of sending some control signal for exampleswitching the pump on to irrigate the field and so on and so forth and there can be doneremotely as well as well as autonomously automatedly so this is what the agrisens system does sothis is the proposed architecture of the agrisens system for offering smart water managementso we have different layers of the system so we have the sensing layer the remote processinglayer and the application layer the sensing layer basically has different types of sensorssoil moisture water level etcetera which through data from different clusters this throughdata through their cluster heads to the remote processing server and different analyticsand run and those data are made made available to the different applications in the applicationlayer so this particular project involved differentobjectives such as the design for the sensors designing the sensor node as such and thedesign of the remote server and the communication framework so as part of this project whatwe did is we developed a sensor that can be used for monitoring the water level in thefield so this is this particular sensor which we have developed in our lab for monitoringthe water level in the field so another sensor which we did not develop but we have procureis the ec zero five soil moisture sensor which in this particular figure as you can see inthis particular picture as you can see has been put ah it has been you know dug insidethe surface of the earth so soil moisture sensor is basically put insideis installed inside the ah the level the level of ah the mud level of mud or level of earthso it is inside it is dug inside so this is the overall design of the sensor node so herebasically what we have is apart from the sensors and actuators we have a processing unit andthe memory unit ah we have wireless communication unit and we have the power management unitso this is the integrate design of a sensor node that we have developed this is this onenode and ah this node basically as you can see over here it comes with an lcd and itis powered by zigbee for communication and zigbee in one of the previous lectures onconnectivity technologies we have already gone through zigbee then ah it also has apower supply it has ah different power supplies then it has a power on indicator a reset switchthe on off on off switch and different sensors can be fitted to this particular coreso this is the the censor board that we have designed and which can be used for agriculturalpurposes smart irrigation purpose then the remote server basically it has a repositorywhich can take all the data from these different sensors these iot nodes through the iot gatewaysand there is a web server ah which basically stores in the field data remotely that meansthe web server are typically stored ah away from the field and that is where the dataare all stored for use in the future and there are multi user servers which basically sendthe field information to the farmers cell using sms technology and also executes thefarmers query and controlling messages so basically this basically helps in informingthe farmers about the field conditions with the help of sms and different sending differentsmses so we will now look at a field demo and thereafteri am going to show you few other different aspects of this particular system so i amgoing to now take you to the field and show you how the system is deployed and how itfunctions at the field now i am going to show you one of the implementations of internetof things in agriculture more specifically this is for irrigation purpose how iot canbe used for irrigation purpose and what we are doing is this is actually by the way ahdeveloped as a sponsored project of ah mhrd and iit kharagpur and this was being developedalong with my colleague professor n s raghuvanshi of the department of agriculture and foodengineering at iit kharagpur so what you see over here is an agriculturalfield so in this field this field is divided into a six by five grid and each of thesegrid elements has a size of three by three square meters and ah so in each of these gridswhat we have is a sensor node and at this point actually you cannot see any crops becausethe crop the season has gone and the crops have been harvested but this is the infrastructurethat we have so this is a solar powered sensor node and if we look here in this node we haveah through this node actually we have two different sensors one is a soil moisture sensorwhich is basically buried in ground and there is another sensor which is the water levelsensor so the soil moisture sensor basically as this name says that it ah it basicallysensors the soil moisture and the water level sensor is how much is the stagnant water levelin this particular grid so this is what it measures and these twosensor data are sent to this particular node and ah so this node basically has you knowit is zigbee power and this data has zigbee communication with the cluster head so hereactually what we use is a cluster based approach cluster architecture for sensor deploymentand ah so from this node ah from every node that we have here the data are sent via zigbeeto the cluster head and from the cluster head cluster head basically supports two typesof communication one is the ah zigbee communication for intra cluster communication ah and theother one is the gprs communication from the cluster head to the ah the the the controlroom where the servers are there for further analysisso this is the architecture that we have and ah so the sensor data you know are being inthe sense from these two sensors one is the soil moisture and the water level sensor andif the water level has gone down or the soil moisture is not adequate enough so automaticallywe have the valves the ah the solenoid valves and the solenoid valves will be turned onso here is one solenoid valve that you can see on your ah on my on my left here the solenoidvalve and likewise every field has other solenoid valvesso there is another solenoid valve there ok and so what is going to happen is the pumpyou know it is going to turned on will be turned on and the water is going to be youknow the the field is going to be irrigated by those ah ah this solenoid valves so asyou can see over here the valve has been turned on just now and the field is going to be irrigatedah with the water because there is no i am not adequate water in the field so as i toldyou that we are actually following a cluster based architecture for the sensor deploymentso here what we have is a cluster head this cluster head has support for both zigbee communicationwhich is happening through this particular node and there is also support for ah gprscommunication through this particular board and additionally we have the different relaysas you can see here for turning on the pumps ah if it is required to irrigate the fieldand so through this antenna basically this communication is happening ah with the withthe external world so this is the this is how the cluster head looks likeso now i will show you the web interface for this agrisens system so as i mentioned toyou earlier it is accessible through the url agrisys dot iit kgp dot ac dot in and we havedeployed this particular system in two locations one in iit kharagpur and the other one ina distant village close to binapur and so this is the overall you know ah web interfaceand as we can see over here that it gives lot of information about the water level sensorthat we have developed the deployed sensor nodes you can read more ah the wireless sensornetwork that is there and the sms service that is offered to the farmers so more informationis available through this site and also through these different links the people that areinvolved i already mentioned to you that it is being it has been done by our group theswan group of the department of cse ah along with the agriculture and food engineeringdepartment at iit kharagpur ah so here ah you know we can through thisparticular portal we can look at the field conditions and the different sensors you knowthe different health monitoring on the different sensors that are there so if you login usingthe login credentialsso this is basically the node status from one of the fields ah as we can see these arethe different status that i had mentioned and these are the different status that ihad mentioned ah so we have ah red colour implying that now actually the clock has alreadybeen harvested it was a paddy paddy field where the sensor nodes are deployed so crophas already been harvested that is why it is showing red colour means that the sensornode is not sensing any further data and also the different status messages you know socan be obtained through this particular portal and previous data also one can see throughthis and ah so this basically you know helps in remote monitoring of the field ah you knoweven if one is in another part of the world still they you would be able to monitor thefield conditions so ah this is how the overall portal lookslike so now i will show you some of the plots of the data that i received at our serveri have already shown you how the different sensors are deployed in the field and theseare some of the results that we have received some of the data that we have received withrespect to things such as the soil moisture so this is the soil moisture data with respectto the time so here actually we have some hundred fifteen days data and as you can seeover here the soil moisture variation with respect to the different phases of crop growthduring the paddy season is basically plotted over here so this particular phase is shownto be the vegetative phase and the soil moisture variation is shown in this particular plotthen we have the reproductive phase where the soil moisture varies like this and thenwe have the maturity phase and in the maturity phase as you can see that there are some variationsin the soil moisture ah of the field the next one is the water level so here actuallywe can see that in the vegetative phase the water level fluctuations are there but itis not too much but then during the reproductive phase the water level fluctuations are quiteso whenever the water level goes down the field is irrigated again water level goesup again it goes down and so on and so forth so this is the reproductive phase and thenwe have the maturity phase where the water level variations are has shown and then thisplot basically shows the packet delivery ratio and ah as we can see over here the packetdelivery is not so bad you know it is between like ninety percent to hundred percent thereis some packet drop that has happened and these packet drops could be due to differentreasons such as different presence of different noises interference and so on due to thingssuch as air flow temperature ah solar radiation rainfall and so on so these packet drops arequite common but as you can see that mostly the system overall is quite reliablethank you
