so we are now going to continue our discussions on the basic issues basic aspects of the networkingin internet of things so we have already seen the different fundamental issues that areout there now we are going to look at the different protocols that are there that canbe used for something different purposes in iotnow ah you know so based on the different functionalities there are actually large numberof protocols that are proposed for use in iot so based on the functionality these protocolsare classified in this ah ah ah in this manner ah so this is just a classification that ahhas been shown but this is not unique classification in anyway and it can be it should be constitutein that manner so this is just a classification attempt ah under different ah categories thatis shown and here as we can see the different protocols for something these ah ah classifiersyou know a different issues are also ah mentioned in brackets ah like this and so it is basicallynot possible and also not required ah to go through all these different protocols so wehave selected only a few protocols from this ah you know red coloured ah category ah andthis is what we are going to discuss ah in ah this particular courseso we will start with the mqtt protocol first and this mqtt the full form of this is messagequeue telemetry transport so it is an iso iso standard which is based on the publishsubscribe model and ah ah so basically you know what happens is there is some kind ofpublishing of the data and then the fetching of the data ah by the subscribers so thisis how this publish subscribe model works and mqtt basically what it has done is thispublish subscribe model it has been made lightweight through the use of this protocol and so thatthis lightweight protocol can be used in conjunction with the tcp ip protocol suit this is whatmqtt supports mqtt going back to the history was introducedin nineteen ninety nine by ibm and is standardized in two thousand thirteen by oasis this isa standardization organization oasis so it has standardized in the year two thousandthirteen so this this particular protocol does couple of things one is offering connectivitybetween different embedded devices between the applications and then middle ware of onedevice and network and communication on the other side of the device so we have connectivitybetween applications and middle ware for one side and the networks and communication onthe other this is what mqtt does so in mqtt there are three concepts that areinvolved the first we are going to go through is the concept of a message broker and firstwe are going to go through some of these concepts and there after i am going to show you pictoriallyhow mqtt functions so we have a message broker the concept of a message broker that basicallyserves like a broker which takes control of publishing of the messages and subscriptionof the messages so publish subscribe is basically controlled by the message broker number onenumber two is there is a concept of topic and this is what the client is subscribedand based on the updates ah ah this the data are sent to the clients by the message brokerdistributed this data are distributed by the message broker to the clients who have subscribedto the services so this is design for remote connections limitedbandwidth environments and mqtt basically the advantage is that it provides every smallcode foot print so basically you know by writing only a small piece of code one would be ableto achieve all these different functions that i have just mentioned the different componentsof mqtt are as follows we have three principle components the publishers which involve thedifferent sensors the subscribers that means those entities those applications those unitsthat are interested in the data that is published by the sensors number three is the brokerin between which helps the publishers and the subscribers connect to one another andalso help in classifying the sensor data into different topicsin mqtt there are a few different methods one is connect the second is disconnect subscribeunsubscribe and publish so basically the connect method helps to connect with the server helpsto connects this device with the server then the disconnect is the opposite whenever itis no longer required to be to remain connected the disconnect method helps in disconnectingfrom the server from the tcp ip ah ah service offerings and so on and then comes the subscribewhich is basically subscribing to the services and ah unsubscribe is the opposite wheneverit is no longer required to continue with getting the ah the different ah data ah offeringsthe data services and so on ah the ah unsubscribe method can be executed and then we have thepublish method which is basically publishing data ah ah for ah ah maybe ah you know publishingthe data ah from ah the ah these different ah sensors or these different in devices tothe broker ah for it ah to be fetched by the different application clientsso this is what i was referring to just a short while back so what we have is this pictorialdepiction of how this publish subscribe model works in the case of mqtt so we have a temperaturesensor we have laptops we have mobile devices this temperature sensor in this example publishesthe temperature which is basically brokered at this mqtt broker so what this fellow doesis it broker you know so because it is a broker between ah the different clients and ah differentother application serving devices you know which required ah the ah the data which cansubscribed to the data that is published by these different sensorsso what it is going to do is first it is going to get the subscription requests from thesedifferent clients the mobile device the laptop and so on and so forth so first is the subscribedand there after it is published so what is published the temperature is published whereis the temperature residing it is fetched from the sensor and it is being brokered atthe mqtt broker so from these those devices those clients which have which have basicallyah subscribed to the services they are going to get this sensing updates the sensor dataupdates so when we look at the communication the architecturethat is follows followed is the publish subscribe publish subscribe architecture and not therequest response architecture that is typically followed by traditional http which is usedfor the internet this publish subscribe model is event driven so that means whenever thereis an event whenever there is a fire when the temperature increases when the whenevera camera may be an iot ah camera ah basically observes some kind of change ah ah in ah inthe environment or whatever maybe ah there is an intruder or whatever it is so the centralcommunication point ah so it is sorry i am sorry so what we have is it is event drivenso whenever there is some kind of an event and ah those data are ah basically pushedto the clients ah ah ah so these messages basically are pushedto the clients and then we have this broker which is in charge of dispatching all themessages between the senders and receivers and each client that publishes a message tothe broker includes a topic into the message and this is the topic which is very much importantin the case of mqtt and this is the topic which is of interest to these applicationclients so each client that wants to receive the messagessubscribes to a certain topic and the broker delivers all the messages with in the matchingtopic in the client to the client so essentially what is happening is the clients they do nothave to know each other and what is required is they only need to communicate with eachother over the topic so they not they do not know to it ah one to know you know about eachother and these architecture basically ah ah appears to be a scalable architecture witha scalable solution there is not much dependency between the producers and the consumers ofthe data and that is where mqtt is very popular in mqtt we have the concept of the topic asi just mentioned a minute back and this topic is nothing but a simple string that can havemore hierarchical levels which are separated by a slash in this manner a simple ah a sampletopic for sending the temperature data of the living room could be marked in this mannercould be named in this manner so we have house in a smart in a smart house kind of ah ahah ah scenario we have house within the house we have [living rim/ah living room] ah livingroom and the temperature that is collected from this particular living room is of interestso this is this topic that is of interest and this is this is a sample this is an exampleof how the topic for sending temperature data of a living room looks likeso on one hand the client like a mobile device a laptop or whatever can subscribe to theexact topic or on the other hand it can also use a wildcard so this an example of an exacttopic wildcard could also be used wildcards can be used in different ways based on thedifferent levels the subscription to house forward slash plus sign forward slash temperatureresults in all messages sent to the previously mentioned topic house living room temperatureas well as any topic with an arbitrary value in the place of a living room such as housekitchen and temperature so basically this you know this plus signis a wildcard character which only allows arbitrary values for one hierarchy if morethan one hierarchical level is required the multilevel wildcard is used so this is singlelevel wildcard the plus one is a single level wildcard and this hash sign is as multilevelwide wildcard it allows to subscribe to all underlying hierarchical levels for examplehouse forward slash hash is for subscribing to all topics beginning with housedifferent applications that use mqtt facebook messenger for online chat amazon website servicesuse amazon it with mqtt microsoft azure iot hub uses mqtt as its main protocol for telemetrymessages the everything iot platform uses mqtt as an m two m ah protocol for connectingseveral products and devices adafruit ah uses mt ah mqtt cloud service for iot experimenterscaller adafruit io finally after understood the overall philosophybehind mqtt let us now quickly review the secured version of mqtt which is called thesecure mtt ah m mqtt the secure mqtt or smqtt in short so this is known in both these waysand these actually to me is quite similar in notion to http and https the secure httpso we have http secure http we have mqtt secure mqttso secure mqtt is an extension of mqtt so basically it is an extension of the mqtt thatthat we just discussed by using different security features such as encryption and soon the advantage of such encryption is the broadcast encryption feature in which onemessage is encrypted and delivered to multiple ah other nodes which is quite common in iotapplications in general the algorithm consists of four main stagesThe setup stage the encryption stage the publish stage and the decryption stage so setup encryptionpublish and decryption in setup phase the subscribers and the publishers register themselvesto the broker and get a master secret key according to the developers choice of keygeneration algorithm so depending on what key generation algorithm is used the subscribersand the publishers register themselves to the ah to the broker and get a master mastersecret key according to that particular algorithm so when the data is published it is encryptedand published by the broker which sends it to the subscribers which is finally decryptedat the subscriber end having the same master secret key the key generation and encryptionalgorithms are not standardized smq ah smqtt is proposed only to enhance the security aspectsof mqtt so in this ah part of the lecture on basictopics ah on iot networks ah so ah what we have done is primarily we have gone throughtwo protocols we have seen that there is an assortment of different protocols that arethey have to support the networking of iot but in this particular part of the lecturewe have focussed mostly on two protocols one is the smtt and the other one is ah the ahah the sorry mqtt and the other one is smqtt so which is basically the secure version ofmqtt so ah we are going to go through few other protocols in the next lecture and ahfrom that we can use them finally to establish to built different platforms for iot in asmall scale or even in the larger scale thank you
