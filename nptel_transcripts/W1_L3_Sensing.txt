so we have already understood the basics of internet of things now let us try to understandthat what are the essential building blocks of internet of things so one of the very essentialcomponents of internet of things is sensors and the other one is actuators so whereasthe sensors basically sense the physical phenomena that are occurring around them the actuatorsbasically based on the sensed information the actuators they actuate that means theyperform some actions on the physical environment so they take some actions based on what hasbeen sensed so essentially if we see that we have a agradual phase wise approach to building internet of things so we have we have sensors whichare sensing the sensors they sense different parameters depending on the sensor being usedfor example temperature pressure humidity conditions lighting conditions and so on thenwhat will happen is these sensed information are going to be sent over a connected systemthat means over a network that information will be passed it can also involve cloud andso on and finally that information is going to be transmitted based on based on what hasbeen sensed and based on the requirements some physical action is going to be takenby an actuator so may be a bulb might be turned on if certainconditions in an agricultural field has happened maybe if the field based on the sensors itis found out that in an agricultural field the field has run out of stagnant water thatis required for paddy crops then what might be required is based on thats that sensedinformation automatically the bulb of the water pump the deep to well that is used ora shallow tube well that is used for irrigation the automatically that bulb will be turnedon so that the field gets irrigated so that can be done through the process ofactuation so we have sensing we have iot or the simply the network and then we have thisactuation so sensing network actuation so we start with the sensing component now andin the next lecture we will try to understand how actuation is doneso when we talk about sensing we need to understand what is sensing so basically a sensor it detectsor senses the changes in the ambient conditions or it can also sense the state of anotherdevice so maybe one sensor can check can sense how what is the state of another device sothis is what he is done with the help of sensing so some physical property of the ambient conditionsof the environment in which the sensor is in or of another machine or a system a separateone these can be sensed with the help of sensors so let me now show you some sensors some realsensors that we have so here are few real sensors this is a sensor that is used forobstacle detection this is a pir sensor passive infrared sense sensors so this passive infraredsensor can here can be used for detecting if there is any obstacle so this is an exampleof a pir or obstacle based sensor then we have another sensor this is the ultrasonicsensor this basically detects that how far that obstacle is this is another sensor sowe here as you can see that there are like two eyes kind of things so what happens isthese ultrasonic sensors may sent ultrasound ultrasound waves so these ultrasound wavesare sent and then they that sound wave is going to get reflected back we already knowwhat is the velocity and then depending on how much time has elapsed from the point soundwave was sensed and the deflection is received back based on that the distance is calculatedso this sensor helps in basically getting an idea or sensing how far an obstacle isfrom a particular point where the sensor is then we have another sensor which is the camerasensor this is as you can see over here is small iot camera since the camera sensorthen we have this one here which is a smoke detection sensor so this sensor can help indetecting the smokeand finally i would like to show you another sensor which is the temperature and humiditysensor this is actually this measures both of these together this particular sensor okso these are some real life sensors real examples of sensors that i have just shown you likethis there are different sensors that can be purchased these sensors they have differentfunctionalities and these functionalities are typically unique that means that one sensorwhich is fabricated to do to measure a certain physical property it cannot measure anotherone or more specifically let me give you an example to illustrate this point because thisis something that many people make a mistake so a temperature can a temperature sensorcan measure temperature only it cannot measure for instance smoke it cannot detect smokeso these are very much application specific you know specific things specific propertiesbasic specific physical properties can only be detected by these sensorsnow the sensors they come in different shapes and sizes they can be very small they canbe very big the same sensors can be mechanical sensors these can electrical sensors theycan be electronic sensors they can be chemical sensors there are so many different typesof sensors and fabrication of a sensor is a completely different ballgame so whetherwhether its a mechanical sensor or an electronic sensor electrical sensor or a ah you knowa chemical sensor so whatever it is it is a completely different ballgame typicallypeople who are into building of iot they focus more on the networking aspects they focusmore on the networking analytics aspects of iotthere are separate researchers who work on the design of these sensors some of thesesensors that i have just shown you the sensors you know that complete the design the fabricationits a completely different story altogether you know so ah you know this can this is andtypically this is done by those who are focusing on sensor design and fabrication so typicallyah they are concerned only about how these sensors can be ah developed they can be fabricatedthey are not bothered about building iot as such of course there can be some researcherswho might also take interest sensors ah you know not just the fabrication of the sensorsbut also going beyond building of the ah iot some ah people might be taking interestingthat but in general it is not so so so the sensors based on certain stimulithe different stimuli might be there they can measure the thing is in the physical characteristicsof the environment of the system and so on and these changes can are basically convertit to electrical signals for example for a heat sensor this heat is converted to electricalsignals and this is for temperature sensors i am sorry this for temperature sensor theheat is converted to electrical signals and for sensors such as atmospheric pressure sensorsah the atmospheric pressure is basically converted to electrical signals ok so we have differentsensors which measure different things but then these sensed values are converted torespective electrical signals now there is an associated terminology whichis for the transducers the terms transducers basically convert one form of energy intoanother one form of energy being converted into another for example in a microphone whatwe have in a microphone so the sound waves are converted to electrical signals the soundwaves are converted into electrical signals and then to a output device like a loudspeakerand we are able to hear ah that sound so this is an example of a transducerso this terms sensors and transducers are very common comp they they they have lot ofoverlap and we have to understand the distinction between these two there is lot of misunderstandingpeople ah conceived sensors and transducers we use these terms almost interchangeablybut there are differences so the word transducer is a collective termwhich includes sensors as well as the actuators that i was telling you before the sensorscan sense what is going on around them and convert to electrical signals etcetera andthe actuators can basically perform these actiou actions by maybe switching voltagesor currents now the sensors have different features theyare sensitive to the property the physical property that is being measured so they cando all they are sensitive only to that measured property so basically a temperature sensorcan sense only the ambient temperature of the room and it is insensitive to other changesmaybe changes in the atmospheric pressure or changes in the lighting condition of thatroom there is a terminology which is called theresolution the resolution of the of a sensor is basically defined as the smallest changethat it can detect in the quantity that is being measured so the smallest change thatit can detect the resolution of a sensor with a digital output is usually the smallest resolutionof the digital output it is capable of processing so based on the output the sensors can beclassified as analog or digital and based on the data type they can be classified asscalar or vector sensors so in the analog sensor what we have these sensors give continuousanalog output so for example tint temperature sensor continuously the changes in the temperatureare going to be sensed measured and the output is going to be an analog signal digital sensorsbasically gives digital outputs on and off for example and like this come you know discretedigital values are given as outputs by these digital sensorsthen scaler sensors basically measure scalar variables which can measure only the changesin the magnitude whereas the vector sensors not only the magnitude but also the directionso scalar sensor example would be temperature sensor is an example of scalar sensor becauseyou know irrespective of which orientation you put the sen ah temperature sensor or inwhich direction you are taking it it is going to give you the magnitude value only the changesin the magnitude of the temperature on the contrary we have the vector sensor for examplethe camera sensor or the accelerometer sensor whose values are dependent on the orientationon the direction and so on direction in which the sensor is being put and the weight ismeasuring so it is dependent on that so we have analog sensors we have digital sensorswe have scalar sensors and we have vector sensorsso analog sensor i already mentioned about analog sensors ah temperature sensor ah youknow temperature is typically measured with the help of thermometer or thermocouple thermometersare quite common but thermocouple is something that is used in the geezers for example youknow so you have two different metallic strips for instance and these strips they know theycan ah the thermocouple in the thermocouple they can bend and so on so these based onthat ah you know based on the amount of bending etcetera ah ah you know they measure the changesin the ah temperature they know so so if you calibrate ah ah the thermocouple you knowso accordingly it is going to give how much the temperature has changed and dependingon that one can understand how much the liquid has heated up or has cooled downdigital sensors produce digital discreet voltage levels or signal levels so binary values likezero and one or on and off or output of the digital sensors scalar sensors measure onlythe magnitude physical quantities such as temperature color pressure strain etceterathese are scalar quantities and measurement of their of the change of magnitude is sufficientto convey the information on the other hand vector sensors produce outputsignal of the voltage which is generally proportional to the magnitude as well as the directionand orientation of the quantity that is being measured so physical quantities such as thesound image velocity acceleration orientation these are all vector quantities and theirmeasurement is not just dependent on the magnitude but also on the direction so for example accelerometersensor they give outputs in three dimensions xy and z coordinate axishere are some examples of different sensors light sensor for measurement of light we havethe ldr which is the light dependent resistor photodiodes this can act as sensors for measurementof light for sensing of light for sensing of temperature we have thermistor and thermocouplethermocouple i briefly told you but thermistor is sort of like thermal transistor kind ofthing ok then we have for force we have the stain straingauge and pressure pressure switch for position we have potentiometers encoders opto couplersopto couplers basically you know ah ah you know so the optical ah ah signals are ah youknow the the the the optical rays are basically obstructed and based on that ah you know theposition information can be obtained so opto couplers then we have the speed for speedsensing we have reflective sensors ah then doppler effect sensors so doppler effect basedon the relative velocity ah for example relative velocity of sound you know so based on thatah that you know this doppler effect sensors they ah they work ah then we have the soundsensors we have the carbon microphone like our existing traditional microphones piezoelectriccrystals and so on for chemical ah sensing we have the liquid chemical sensors and gaschemical sensors so i had already in at the outset of thislecture i had shown you some real physical sensors here are some other pi ah picturesof few other sensors here is a pressure sensor here is ah an ultrasonic distance sensor tiltsensor infrared motion sensor camera sensor analog temperature sensor so analogs in ahtemperature sensor it has ah you know in addition to the output it has two ah so it has threepins basically one is for the plus five volts the other one is the ground zero volts ahand ah this one is the the middle pin is typically used for the outputnow the sensors often they do not give data that is accurate you know so there are somesensorial deviations so these sensors they have each sensor they come with certain specificationsthese specifications will give you the maximum and the minimum values that it can measureof the physical property that it is supposed to measure the sensitivity of a sensor underreal conditions may differ from the value that is specified and that is known as thesensitivity error and then each sensor there can be given you know a a value which is constantlythe same constantly diff different so what i mean by this is the correct value mightbe some something and always it will be giving this particular sensor might be giving a valuewhich is an offset error or a bias and that might so that many units of offset error readingit will be giving at all times and that will be constant so for example two units of offsetmaybe might be given by a temperature sensor at all times so that is different from thesensitivity error that i told you so sensitivity error is more about being sensitiveto the changes you know ah to ah you know under real conditions basically how it isbeing sensitive then what is specified in their actual specifications in their actualspecification it might give certain certain ah ah ah in the actual specifications it mightsuppose be suppose to give certain ah ah values but in real conditions it might be sensitiveto certain things so this becomes the sensitive error and there will be some error that willbe due to that and that sensitivity error that can change over time and that is differentfrom the offset error which is constant over timenow these the sensors typically have linear behavior most of the sensors most of the sensorsnot all have a linear behavior so but there is often in practice a non linearity behaviorthat is exhibited by the sensors and ideally they should behave linearly but in practicestays off will behave nonlinear so this non linearity is the deviation of the sensorstransfer function from linearity so this is basically defined as the amountof the output that differs from the ideal transfer function behavior over the full rangeof the sensor so if the output signal slowly changes independent of the measured propertythis is known as drift so it might so happen that a particular sensor at one point we givea certain value and then if you use the same sensors for measuring the same condition dueto the drift you might get a drifted sensed value so it will be different it might bedifferent so it induces some drift if you keep it overtimeso the other type of error is the noise which is basically due to different other externalfactors and its a random deviation of the signal with time hysteresis error is bit differentand typically it is exhibited by analog sensors magnetic sensors heating of in a sensors thatare you that use the principle of heating of metal strips and so onso in these se ah ah sensors ah these analog sensors or magnetic sensors and so on sometimeswhat happens that the present reading depends on the past input values how maybe becauseit uses some metal strips and maybe the property of the or the functionality of that sensoris such that when you heat it it is going to the metal strip is going to bend so soyou know if it has bent once to come back to its original posi position it will takesome time so this type of error basically talks about that you know if if it is heatedonce you will get something so based on that if you heat it once again you know you aregoing to your output is going to be dependent on the previous value so this is an errorthis is known as the hysteresis error there are different other errors such as quantizationerror which ah ah which is basically if the sensor has a digital output the output isessentially an approximation of the measured property and this is known as the quantizationerror if you are sampling the signals this leads to a type of error which is known asaliasing error and the sensors ma may at times be sensitive to the properties then the propertythat is being measured for example a temperature sensor might also sometimes be sensitive tofew of the other things that are not directly being measured maybe ah you know may maybeah the the humidity or pressure at times or maybe light this will depends actually i meanthis is not a perfect example that i have given you but you know so it can be constitutethis particular error can be constituting this way that sometimes the physical propertythat is being measured that my may gat get affected that sensor may get affected by fewof the other properties that are not directly being measured so this also leads to somekind of error so with this we come to an end of ah the topicof sensors so here we have already seen that there are different types of sensors and ihave shown you some real life sensors that can be used for building of internet of thingsi have also shown you pictures of many other sensors and these sensors are used ah ah ahah in something known as the sensor nodes the sensor nodes are eventually going to getconnected they are not going to be networked together internetwork together and togetherthat is going to form an internet of things and this internet of things is going to ahbe used for improving the overall service quality in the society of the business ofthe environment as a whole thank you
