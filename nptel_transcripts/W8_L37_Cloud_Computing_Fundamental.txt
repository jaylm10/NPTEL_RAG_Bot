so this lecture is on cloud computing and this is the first lecture on the series ofcloud computing so the first one will be on fundamentals so here in this lecture i amgoing to speak about some of the basic motivation behind cloud computing particularly from theuse of cloud computing in internet of things then about some of the basic models of cloudthat are popularly used and also how the cloud can be deployed in different environmentsand the models there of so this particular lecture is focused on these specific issuesso before we start i would like to mention a few different things so the first thingis that why do you need cloud so let us try to understand this thing why do we need cloudand the second thing that will try to understand is why do we need cloud specifically for internetof things and that will basically justify why we are devoting a few lectures on cloudcomputing in a course on iot so the second one will come next but let us first look atwhat is cloud so cloud computing is all about using computing as utilityso we all are users of different utilities utilities such as electricity utilities suchas water resources and so on and so forth so electricity water supply etcetera are utilitieswhich we use first of all we have to subscribe to those utilities then some connections willbe given at our home for those utilities then there will be some meter which is going tomeasure how much units of electricity or water we are using at our home and based on ourunits of usage we are going to be finally built at the end of the month for the useof these resources so what did we see that if i have to use electricityat my home if i have to use water at my home it is not required for me to be bothered atall about deploying the necessary infrastructure for generation of electricity for the transmissionof electricity similarly the pumping out of water from river or ground or the distributionof the water i do not i do not really have to be worried at all about thisso i subscribe to these utilities i will be given a connection at my home for this utilitiesthen based on the units of usage of these resources electricity water etcetera at theend of the month i will be billed for this i will be billed for this so what did we seethat i do not really have to bothered about how the electricity or water was generatedor pumped out how it was distributed so i do not need to be worried about all i needto be worried about is whenever i required i will be using it and at the end of the monthi should be paying for the units of usage so this basically can serve as a motivationbehind why cloud computing is required in the same way as water is a utility electricityas a utility people thought about can we have computing as utility what does it mean computingas utility computing means what computing means hardware resources like servers workstationswhich again include processors which can do certain computations etcetera memory storageand so on so these computational resources hardware plus software resources plus developmentplatforms so all these things offered as utility why do we need because that will have somebusiness value that will save some cost and it also has certain advantages and this iswhat we are going to learn in this particular lectureso first let us have a quick glance through how computing evolved over the years so youmust have already heard about cluster computing grid computing at least these two you musthave heard about so cluster computing is basically you know having some kind of computing nodesconnected together in the from form of a cluster so the cluster as a whole which can be looselyor tightly connected the cluster as a whole would be accomplishing some computationaljob which will be it will be executing some computational job so this is cluster computinggrid computing is sort of like a wide area kind of heterogeneous computing platform whichwill be performing large volumes of tasks or tasks which are large in size then we havethe utility computing where this resources the computational resources are packaged fordelivering as utility for use by consumers as utilityso this is the whole premise of how utility computing evolved and then we have this cloudcomputing which was basically sort of like an integration of the concepts from all thesecom cluster computing distributed sorry ah grid computing and utility computing theiradvantages put together in order to have this new model of computing which is known as thecloud computing so in cloud computing we have shared pool of configurable computing resourcesshared pool of resources and whenever it is required wherever it is required dynamicallythese resources will be offered will be offered to the users as service on paymentso this is like a scalable kind of model that that has been conceptualized over all thesecluster grid and utility computing models so you know cloud is more or less a very recentkind of phenomenon it started in the mid nineteen ninetys and in the last few years it has becomeeven more popular there are different commercially available cloud platforms that are there peopleare still using it companies are subscribing to these cloud services but going back inthe nineteen fiftys people were more concerned concerned about time shared mainframe computersin the nineteen sixtys arpanet and the like oriented network based services became popularvirtual machines became popular in nineteen seventys nineteen ninetys the internet wasexpanded virtual private networks were formed and in the late or mid nineteen ninetys onwardscloud computing came into being popularity has been more in the last couple of yearsof cloud computing different platforms offering software you as utility platform as utilityinfrastructure as utility are offered by different companies such as sales force dot com amazonweb services amazon ec two ah google app engine and so on so these are the different companieswhich are basically daily ah offering these different services as utilitynow when we talk about cloud computing nist has done quite a bit of work on in ah cloudcomputing it in fact has some literature and as per that literature of nist cloud computingis defined in this particular way i will read it out for you it is there in front of theslide in front of you in the slide and for the benefit ah of everyone let me read itout for you cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient on demand network accessto a shared pool of configurable computing resources example network infrastructure serversstorage applications etcetera so there are few key words that will drilldown for the convenient network access so whenever it is required for me at any timeof the day at any time of the month whenever it is required conveniently i should be ableto get network access to the to these different resources that we just went through that wejust gone have gone through on demand on demand means that whenever it is required i shouldbe able to on my demand i should be able to get access to these resources and there isa shared pool of resources which are configurable shared pool that means that these serversstorage etcetera etcetera which will be shared all across and the config computing platformis configurable with respect to ah ah these network infrastructure ah you know serversetcetera so basically it might so happen that ah youknow ah as a user my job as a cloud user my ah you know computational job is getting executedto me it i will get a feeling that it is get getting executed at my dedicated machine thathas been given to me by the cloud platform but in actuality physically maybe there aremultiple servers which are geographically separated from one another which are togetherbeing pooled to execute different parts of my job so this is basically you know to meit is like a single entity which i am using but in the back end there is so much of seamlessnessthat is there that i would not be able to understand that how and where and when thingsare getting executed i in fact do not need to be worried at all about it of course iwould tell you that it is not that i dont dont need to be completely worried cloud computingalso has some privacy security concerns as well so will you know for this course we arenot going to understand what are these issues but there are indeed certain issues but wewill consider that you know there is no such issue and you know i do not really need tobe worried about how when and ah where my ah computation job that i have is gettingexecuted but to me i will get a feeling that i am paying for it and it is getting executedat my end actually it is not happening that way it is because of virtualization that iam getting such a feeling so i will talk about it in ah more detaillater on so cloud computing is sort of like a step ahead of utility computing it providesabstraction or high level generalization of the computation and storage software platformetcetera from and this kind of abstraction is made available to the end users for useon a paper use basis the resources are in a cloud platform rapidly allocatable and theycan be also released whenever it these resources are no longer required and that can thesecan be done with low management effort so there are some essential characteristicssomething called the service models and the deployment models which we are going to gothrough of cloud computing so what are these essential characteristics broad network accessis one so this network you know access is offered in such a way that from anywhere andfrom from anywhere in the world geographically even if i am distributed at different locationsmy company has different so i would still be able to get access to these cloud resourcesso these computational resources rapidly elasticity means that as and when required you know ifi require more i would be able to scale up and i should be able to get these computationalresources if i require less i should be able to scale down so this dynamic scaling hasto be made possible through cloud third is measured services paper use you knowso i would be paying for the units of utility cloud utility that means the computationalutility that i am using on demand self services so whenever required i should be able to subscribeto and be able to get access to these services resource pooling means that you know if aparticular server is not able to physically you know ah physically ah give the servicesah has per requirement then the services can be ah a can can be obtained from other serversother physical computers by pooling resources from them so these are some of these essentialcharacteristics of cloud computing and there are different service models the very popularsoftware as a service platform as a service and infrastructure as a service in short theseare popularly termed as s a a s saas paas and iaas and in terms of deployment thereare different models like the public cloud private cloud hybrid cloud and the communitycloud so we will talk about each of these servicemodels and deployment models later on so what are the businesses advantages i told you thatcloud has certain business advantages so without any upfront infrastructure investment a companywho has computational requirements they do not have to go and buy their own servers forinstance and use them but with in almost zero cost of infrastructure investment in termsof procurement deployment etcetera the you know they should be able to get access tothis computing resources on demand on ah ah whenever it is required in a ubiquitous mannerreal time infrastructure able ah ability means that the infrastructure is going to be madeavailable for real time use at any time the resources are going to be made available andwill be made available for real time access more efficient resource utilization so theseresources will be utilized in a more efficient manner usage based con ah costing ah is anotherthing so usage based costing means you know based on how much i am using these resourcesi would i would be billed for those units only reduce time to market because you arenot basically investing time and of course money for procurement for initiating the procurementfor process tendering ah then ah you know ah getting all the infrastructure buying themthe delivery time etcetera etcetera and then starting to use so you are cutting down onthe time to market of the product that the company is building because whenever you requireyou are getting access to your computational resources over the internet at any timeso basically you know we we have not you through the use of cloud computing we have not spenttoo much of time on the procurement of these computational resources which otherwise traditionallyused to happen and that would kill significant amount of time in business some general characteristicsimproved agility in resource provisioning is one this i do not need to explain explainfurther ubiquity independence of device or location multitenancy which basically talksabout sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users dynamic load balancingmeans that the computation or even communication load it would be it is possible through thecloud model to be able to dynamically balance the load throughout the entire cloud platformcloud system this cloud model is highly reliable because physically if some network ah somecomputational resource has gone down or is broken or is not available for whatever reasonyou know there are other resources which can be easily pooled into and be made availableto the users so it is highly reliable and is scalable likewiseso for the same reasons this is scalable as well and cloud also comes with low cost andlow maintenance for the company the users of the company which is investing on in whichwas traditionally investing on infrastructure and improved security and access control aswell so you know so these are some of the different characteristics of cloud computingso let us start with the essential characteristic the first one is the broad network accesscloud resources should be available over the network and this is what is happening overthe internet the cloud resources are man made available and it should support the standardmechanisms for information retrieval using traditional interfaces for example differentclients could be used different types of clients whether thick client the thin clients or mobilephones laptops etcetera these all are supported in a cloud platform so basically what is goingto happen you can very easily you can use thin platforms and it is like a bare basicterminal which will be you can simply have to you have to buy those low cost cheap barebasic terminals the thin clients etcetera and the computation the resources are goingto be made available to you through the cloud platform you simply need to have some networkaccess the broad network access in the form of internet or the like and should be ableto connect to the cloud in order to get access to those resourcesrapid elect elasticity so cloud resource allocations should be rapid elastic and automatic dynamicallocation and release of facility for scaling in and scaling out of resources should bemade possible so whenever additional resources are required you know it should be able toah you know ah ah the cloud should be able to scale out that means increase the scalabilityof these resources and whenever it is no longer required scaling in ah should be made possibleby the release of these resources to the consumers consumers feel that it is a highly elasticsystem seamlessly things are integrated in such a way that the consumers feel that theyhave access to infinite resources and the fac and there is facility for adding or removingof quantity should be there in cloud so whatever you know if you need more quantity or if youneed less quantity the addition or the release of resources ah to reduce the number shouldalso be made available and this is the property of rapid elasticity so elastically we shouldbe able to expand [elastic/ elastically] elastically we should be able to reduce and release resourcesthrough the cloud model its a measured service resources and theiruses would be recorded and monitored so the use of these resources should be recordedand monitored and at the end of a particular time duration maybe a month or so the thethe cloud service provider is going to send out a bill to the end user in order for themto be able to pay for it so this can also be done at the same time you pay immediatelyand then get access to your resources immediately as well so there should be facility to dynamicallycontrol and optimize the resource usage and this facility should be transparent betweenthe service provider and the consumer on demand self service self service means you know wheneverrequired the user should be able to get access to this resources through a self service mannerand cloud should be able to provide the server time and network storage to users automaticallyon demand whenever it is required resource pooling means that it is sort of like a multimulti tenancy model where there are multiple end users and automatically as per the requirementthe whole available resources would be made available ah will should be ah made automaticallyavailable and should be pooled from all these available ah sources the resources shouldbe allocated according to the users demand there are different components of cloud computingfrom the user end you have these clients and the end users which may who may use thin clientswhich are very popular in a cloud model so which are low cost as well they could be usingthe thick the traditional thick clients as well or the mobile devices as clients servicesproduct solutions applications like web apps you know softwares service platforms suchas ah you know web hosting platforms application hosting platforms ah should ah ah ah shouldbe made available through the cloud computing storage for instance different databases thendata storage as a service are ah components of cloud computing and infrastructure lastlywhich is very important should be virtualized and be made available in the form of infrastructureas a service model and i am going to talk about that shortlyso different service models include the software as a service platform as a service and infrastructureas a service these service models have been very popular since the last few years i meanfrom from the time cloud computing became very popular these service models are poorservice models of cloud computing but mind you that at present people are also talkingabout different other types of service so not just software platform and infrastructureas a service but also something like x as a service where x could be anything some peopleare talking about hardware as a service some peoples people are talking about sensors asa service like that database as a service security as a service people are talking aboutall different types of service models made available through cloudso if you look at this particular figure we have all these cloud models so we have theservers underneath then infrastructure as a service platform as a service and applicationas a service clients are getting access to each of these different computational resourcesthrough different interfaces so we have the first one which is software as a service thecommonly used software as a service platforms available commercially is the google appsthe sales force learn dot com and so on so as this name suggests software as a servicebasically gives you facility to execute service providers applications at the users end soapplications are available as services services can be accessed via different types of clientdevices example web browsers apps different types of apps and so onso end users do not basically possess the control of the cloud infrastructure platformas a service examples include the commercially available windows azure google app engineand so on so here basically the development platform is basically made available to theconsumers as facilities to execute consumer created and acquired applications on to thecloud infrastructure infrastructure as a service basically talks about most of this computinginfrastructure like network storage operating system to be made available as facilitiesthrough the internet accessing these facilities as computational resources dynamically wheneverit is required on a paper use basis operating systems other applications can also be madeavailable through this facility so popular examples of infrastructure as a service includethe amazon ec two go grid iland rackspace cloud servers and so onnow let us talk about having spoken about the different service models software as aservice platform as a service and infrastructure as a service let us now talk about how cloudis deployed typically what are the different deployment models that are available in cloudcomputing we have number one the public cloud the second is the private cloud the thirdis the hybrid cloud and there could be other types of cloud like community cloud distributedcloud multi cloud inter cloud and so on so you know private cloud is internal to an organizationand these cloud resources are made available to the users within the institution only sofor example in iit kharagpur we have our own private cloud which is known as the meghamalaso like that different organizations have their own private cloud but there are somepublicly hosted cloud facilities which are available off campus off premises and theseare made available by different companies like amazon like ah ah tcs and different othercompanies who are sort of like service providers of these cloud so these are public cloud thatare that are available hybrid cloud basically is sort of like an integration of some featuresof private cloud and some features of the public cloud so the public cloud is set upfor the use of any person or industry typically it is owned by any organization who offersthe cloud service examples include amazon web services google compute engine and microsoftazure the advantage is that this is easy to set up at low cost as the provider coversthe hardware application and bandwidth cost or any other cost that is made that is inavailable to them so this basically is a highly scalable modelyou just pay for the resources that are being used and there will be lack of wastage ofresources so it is a highly scalable model that can be made available on a payment basisprivate cloud is typically restricted to a single organization the cloud functionalitiesare made available only within the organization typically these are managed by the organizationitself or a third party and the advantages is that there is total control over the systemand the data in such a private cloud being deployed deployed of course there is someinitial investment in setting up the cloud but once it is done then this model is quiteadvantageous it is low cost and these resources can be made available to the users of theorganization on ah on on ah their requirement basis the disadvantage is that you have tobe bothered too much about the regular maintenance you need to have a group which will be regularlyperforming the maintenance tasks in a private cloudso comparison wise public cloud and private cloud in terms of the virtualized resourcesin public cloud these resources are publicly shared in a private cloud this resources areprivately shared customer type in a public cloud ah is basically multiple customers andin a private cloud only a few customers who are typically limited ah or users of the organizationlike the employees of the organization or the students of an organization ah are basicallyah ah users of ah they they servers as the customers of the private cloud in terms ofconnectivity public cloud is made available over the internet and private cloud over theinternet as well as through the private network of the organization in terms of security publiccloud security is much lower compared to the security issues in a private cloud and thereis a hybrid cloud as i said before with basically combines the facilities of ah two or moretypes of unique cloud types for example private community or public cloud the resources inthis case are pooled together by standardized tools some resources can be pooled from aprivate infrastructure some from the public infrastructure and together this cloud modelbasically offers different services to their inducersthen we have this community cloud typically this is restricted to certain communitieslike medical community hospital community security community compliance so only theusers of that community would be able to get access to the services of such a cloud sothis is known as the community cloud and then we have the distributed cloud which comesin different flavors where there is collection of the scattered set of computing devicesin different locations however connected to a single network and there are two types ofdistributed cloud the public resource computing and the volunteer cloud so we are not goingto go through it in the interest of time multi cloud basically its a you know heterogeneousarchitecture single architecture combining multiple different cloud platforms togetherto increase the fault tolerance and flexibility of the system inter cloud is basically cloudof clouds so you have multiple different different clouds which are put together unified throughthe internet and these basically would interoperate between each other between the different cloudservice providers and that joint cloud of cloud services is going to be made availableto the users so these are the different models of cloud deploymentso this comparison ah of this private public and ah this community cloud are as followsso in this particular table as you can see that private cloud is on premise and offersdedicated access the privately hosted cloud is off premise and has dedicated access aswell and ah the community cloud is on premise and offer shared access and the public cloudis off premised offered offers shared access so with this we come to an end of the lectureon the fundamentals of cloud computing so we have a series of three more lectures onthis particular topic of cloud computing we have already understood at the outset of thislecture about why cloud computing is being very popular in the internet of things communitycloud is i will talk about it later on as well but cloud you can understand that itis one of the most important enabling technologies or if core building block for internet ofthings development because you have to deal with heterogeneous resources offering differenttypes of data collecting different type of data which has to be processed quite fastwithout much in you know infrastructure involvement that means this infrastructure ah ah shouldbe taken care of quite automatically i do not have to really buy this infrastructureand waste time and money for it i should be able to get access to these resources andi should be able to enjoy the computing facility on a paper use kind of modeled so this isall about cloud computing in the next lecture we will talk about some more details of cloudcomputing thank you
