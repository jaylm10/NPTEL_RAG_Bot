so let us now continue our discussion of industrial iot so earlier we understood the basics ofiiot how iiot differs in principle from regular iot whats the difference between iot and mto m and having understood all of these different basic concepts we are now about to understandthat what are the specific applications of iiot in the industrial sector so some of thekey application areas of iiot are manufacturing industry health care industry transportationand logistics mining and firefighting in terms of manufacturing in a manufacturing industrythere are lot of manufacturing devices there are equipments work force supply chain workplatform different work platforms are there so these have to be integrated and connectedto achieve smart production so they have to be internetworked so we have different manufacturingmachines manufacturing devices equipments work force then the entire supply chain manufacturingsupply chain from production to the end users the entire supply chain and then the workplatform so all of these have to be integrated and connected to improve the production overallindustrial productionso these have to be done in order to reduce the operational costs improve the productivityof the worker reduce injuries at the workplace this is very important actually safety applicationsof iiot are very important these are very interesting and these are very popular safetyapplications so y o e one to use iiot is one of the important applications is to improvethe safety in the manufacturing plant in the industrial different other types of plantsresource optimization and waste reduction is also very important industrial you knowthis is a very important ah ah important problem resource optimization is a very importantproblem in a industrial engineering so these has to be taken care of waste reduction aswell and end to end automation so this is very important in its a very important requirementin the manufacturing industry and it has to be taken care ofin the second application of iiot is in the health care sector so you know using iiotsolutions patients can be continuously monitored due to the implanted on body sensors whichcan improve the treatment outcome overall costs of treatment can be reduced improveddisease detection can be done and improved accuracy from the data that is that are collectedcan be achieved an overall the drugs drugs that are administered on the patients andthe overall inventory the control of the drugs the procurement control storage and so onof the drugs they can be improvedso iiot solutions are very attractive in the health care sector in the transportation andlogistics sector as well in order to improve transportation safety efficiency of transportationintelligent transportation systems can be developed which consists of connected vehiclesso one of the key building blocks for transportation iiot applied to transportation is the conceptof intelligent transportation system or connected vehicles so intelligent transportation systemscome in different forms we have the concepts of in its we have the concepts of vehicleto sensor connectivity vehicle to vehicle connectivity vehicle to internet connectivityand vehicle to road infrastructure connectivityso there are different types of connectivitys that are required in its there is short rangecommunication in the form of dsrc that enables the ah the realization of vehicle to vehicleand vehicle to road infrastructure communication v to v v to r sometimes it is also known asv to i v to ah vehicle to infrastructure communication so dsrc is very important key enabling technologyfor achieving the objective of vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to roadside infrastructurecommunication in iiot scenario the physical objects are provided with bar codes rfid tagsso that real time monitoring of the status and location of the physical objects may bethe trucks who are they are what you know what is the condition of the different goodsthat are carried in the trucks all of these things can be monitored in real time fromthe origin irrespective of where the trucks are entire supply chain can be monitored withiiot solutions entire supply chain the status of the good that ah status of the vehicleyou know everything can be monitoredsecurity and privacy of the data should also be maintained and that is quite obvious ido not need to elaborate further on this particular aspect in the mining industry very importantindustrial ah sorry industrial iot solutions are very important in the mining industryit is very common to have different types of accidents in the mines so rfid based solutionsare wifi and different other sensors and other wireless technologies zigbee bluetooth etceteracan be deployed to collect data to provide early warning before any disaster actuallystrikes can be used in the mines to improve to monitor not improve but monitor the airquality what is the air quality and this is the very important problem in the mining sectoryou know monitoring the air quality inside the mine detecting the presence of differenttypes of poisonous gases sox gas x nox gases and ah you know ah different other poisonousgases like carbon mono oxide and so on inside the mines which is a very common problem howmuch is the oxygen level inside the mine so all of these things can be monitored insidethe mines using iiot solutionsfirefighting is another rfid tags can be fitted to these different devices for firefightingfor automatic diagnosis early warning in the you know in the firefighting ah in the fireinfrastructure that are deployed typically in the buildings different rfid tags differentsensors can be fitted to these you know fire detection devices emergency rescue and providingreal time monitoring so all these will improve the overall ah overall security and safetyof public infrastructureso some of the examples of iiot include use of unmanned aerial vehicles or the drownsto inspect oil pipelines monitoring food safety using sensors minimizing workers exposureto noise chemicals hazardous materials and so on unmanned ah marine vehicles can be deployedto collect data you know annually or throughout throughout the year throughout the monthsand so on without any fuel or crew so what we have are connected ecosystems inthe iiot domain so what we have is we have traditional supply chains and these traditionalsupply chains in these industries are linear typically linear in nature so it is requiredto shift the business focus from products to outcomes and for that these digital ecosystemscan come iiot based digital ecosystems can come to rescue so digital ecosystems progressat much faster rate than the physical industries hence it can quickly adopt sorry adapt tothe changes in the external environmentsso it is required to integrate digital technologies with the human work force so you know iiotcannot be exclusively m to m this we have to remember we have to have humans in theloop so humans will work with machines and the overall outcome will be improved productivityof the system so iiot will reform and redefine the skills of the workers new jobs can becreated with the help of iiot it is not that you know typically people think that automationor iiot based solutions will cut down on the number of jobs but that is not true so jobsnew jobs get get created because you know new technologies get introducedthings like a you know new composite industries precision agriculture digital health caredigital mines these require you know skilled man power and these skilled man power is whatis required and you know this automation through iiot is in turn going to create new jobs withrequiring new skill sets ah and you know so this basically you know ah iiot will not cutdown on the required number of jobs in the industriesrobots robots have traditionally been used in the industry and in iiot robots are a veryimportant component you know in a new form in a new way robots can be used and theserobots can sense they can think they can act they can perform different tasks so they willbe formed with the ability to carry out repetitive tasks robots will be more intelligent theyare more intelligent and they walk under the supervision of they can also work under thesupervision of human beings their availability increases and they can be programmed reprogrammedand so on and so forth to perform new tasks and that way they can learn faster okso robots in a reformed manner can be used in the iiot to perform the industrial processesin a much more efficient manner in much more faster way decisions can be made and so onover all improving the industrial processes industrial ah you know efficiency industrialsafety and so on so some of the challenges of ah iiot building iiot are listed over hereidentification of objects or things is important and we already looked at the identificationof these things you know how do you associates identifiers to these things we have alreadylooked into these in the context of ah regular iot and the same applies here as wellmanaging huge amount of data is another challenge to be worked on in order to ah address theproblems of iiot in order to deploy iiot solutions integrating existing infrastructure into newiiot infrastructure and enabling data storage these are some of the challenges behind iiotthere are safety challenges as i told you before safety is very important its a fundamentalproblem in in the industry in the industrial sector safety is crucial so whether we aretalking about the health care industry because you know in the health care industry as wellin the hospitals and health care workers they are exposed to lot of problems they are exposedto lot of ah ah challenges and which can harm their health and so onthe same thing for if we are talking about mining industry if we are talking about theah the transportation industry if we are talking about ah the steel industry ah and differentother industries there are lot of safety challenges ah that are there and so workers health andsafety are of primary concern in these industry so worker health and safety regulatory complainsthere are different regulatory bodies in a requiring ah ah you know complains of ah themachines the people their processors in the industry and so on so these ah ah and regulatorycompliance with respect to safety particularly is very crucialenvironmental protection is ah ah is very important you know industries and environmentthey often do not go hand in hand so lot of ah challenges exist ah ah and lot of challengesare posed by the industries on the ah ah on the environment in which they ah they arethey work ah then optimized operations so these are some of these challenges ah ah particularlyconcerning safety in ah industrial safety ah that have to be taken care of though iiotsolutionsthere are different hazards as well handling of different hazardous substances storingof the hazardous substances and so on oxygen deficiency particulate matters so particulatematters like you know fly ash and so on ah then radiation ah different types of radiationelectromagnetic radiation and so on and ah and physiological stress all these are differenttypes of hazards that have to be taken into consideration ah ah for offering ah challengesthrough the use of iiot standardization is very important ah in the development of anysystem so in the context of iiot what is required is to improve the interoperability of thedifferent systems applications and allowing the products and services to perform betterin terms of standardization the problems related to standardization include interoperabilitysemantic interoperability so there is a difference so in semantic interoperability basicallyone is focusing on data semantics ok so the meaning so the you know interoperability interms of semantics is what semantic interoperability specifically takes care security and privacyand radio access level issues there are different privacy and security issues as well the twomost important concerns needed with iiot are information security and data privacy protectionthe devices and the things can be tracked monitored and connected so they there arechances of attack as it happens in any other type of network as well this iiot is alsoa network its a huge network network where different machines crucial machines thereare different systems humans everybody is connectedso these are prone to different attacks there could be different vulnerabilities in thesenetworks so consequently ah you so you know so these has to be taken care of the securityissues have to be taken care of privacy is very crucial because from the industry thereare different data the sensors are collecting so the privacy of these data have to be takecare of so information security data ah privacy protection all these are very crucial issuesin the context of iiot building of iiotso for example in the health care industry the medical data of the patient must not betampered or altered by any person in the middle in the food industry the deterioration ofany food item that is being sent to the company should be kept confidential as it will affectthe reputation of the company so these are very important ah you know privacy challengesor security challenges posing the building of iiot solutions through iiot ah a sorrythough iiot provides new opportunities but few at factors may cause the hindrance inthe path to success these include the lack of vision and leadership lack of understandingof values among the management employees costly sensors and in adequate infrastructure sothese are some of the risks that are that are faced by ah people who want to the managementwho want to deploy iiot in the industryso other challenges include improvement at the sensors miniaturization of the sensorsis very crucial you know we are talking about you know day by day we are talking about verysmall scale small sized sensors that can perform as good as if not better than these existingbig sized sensors so miniaturization of the sensors is very important now a days we aretalking about name spaced sensors which make the senor the shape of the the the size ofthe sensor very small and these seniors can perform very well as well even if they aresmall in size they can perform very well and the overall by through the miniaturizationprocess ah the overall cost and energy consumption ah the overall cost can be brought down andthe energy consumption ah can also be addressed can also be improved because small sized sensoris lightly to consume less energy compared to bigger sized sensorsso the others ah challenges with respect to manufacturing so ah you know when we are talkingabout ah ah ah manufacturing typically these are software based computer based and theseare used to improve the overall operational efficiency so predictive maintenance savingson scheduled repairs reduced cost maintenance costs and reduced number of break downs areimportant challenges ah ah ah and important issues that have to be taken into considerationwhile trying to ah ah to to introduce iiot in the manufacturing industryso there was an industry the rt tech software so this basically particularizes in softwarewhich improves the industrial facilities efficiency and improves the overall industrial productivityso energy management solution which leads to reduction in the plants highest variablecost was ah ah was ah a produced was ah designed and this particular company automates theprocesses of ,mapping and managing energy consumption the products that they developah include m to m based ah communication based systems and intelligent radio modems and theseare the some of these products and their specifications given over here these devices provide easymaintenance and installation they can be connected to ip or non ip devices to extend the capabilityto monitor and communicate with other technologiesso this is a solution that they have developed a product that they have developed it is knownas control which offers io link to the master gateway so it can be easily integrated intothe industrial network with existing and new installations it supports ethernet and ipand ah and ah also supports the modbus tcp so there are different benefits of iiot improvingthe connectivity among devices improving efficiency updating the scalability so easily one canscale up ah ah by the use scale up in the industrial sector ah industrial processescan be scaled up industrial ah ah you know overall industrial productivity can be scaledup through the use of iiot reduction in the operation time can be achieved in the industrythrough the use of iiot solutions remote diagnosis can be performed quite efficiently with thehelp of iiot and ah iiot solutions offer cost effective solutionsin terms of the research ah recent research trends one is to improve the communicationamong the different things or objects to second is to develop energy efficient techniquesso as to reduce power consumption by the sensors third is to develop context aware internetof things middleware for better understanding of the sensor data and the forth is to createsmart smart objects with larger memory processing and reasoning capabilitiesso these are some of the different features the different applications of iiot and howhow iiot can improve the productivity in the industry in the different plants manufacturingplants the health care ah sector and so onso iiot systems ah they have requirement for very small sized ah less expensive sensorswhich are easily accessible ah ah and ah ah so this basically will help in the furtheringthe use of iiot ah more in the industry ah then the second thing is the assembly lineso you know controlling the assembly line automate monitoring control and maintenanceof the ah industrial processes and ah the ah the industrial product lines these canbe achieved efficiently with the help of industrial iotso these are some of the references ah and ah these can be ah you know so ah this ahreference is ah good for understanding connected vehicles ah it was published in the i triplee internet of things and this is something that i should mention that ah on ah internetof things there is a journal which is called the i triple internet of things journal ahwhich ah has number of papers ah on the different aspects of industrial internet of things ahso this concerns basically in transportation sector like this there are different otherproblems and solutions mining related ah papers are also available safety related papers onthe use of iiot ah are also available so these are the different references and ah so withthis we come to an end of ah the discussions on industrial iotthank you
