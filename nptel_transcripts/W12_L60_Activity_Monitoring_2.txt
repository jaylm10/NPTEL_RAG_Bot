hello in this second part of the case study on activity monitoring we will be going througha brief demonstration of a smartphone based activity monitoring system so its a very basicset up that means we have a smartphone with us we have a remote server and we have a networknow nowadays smartphones are as good as computers laptops pcs so and in fact in some cases theyare even more powerful than traditional pcs so what we are planning on doing is sinceeveryone carries a smartphone nowadays almost everyone is using a smartphone nowadays sowe are going to use the inbuilt sensors and we are going to try to transmit the data fromthe smartphone sensors over the network to a remote server on which we can visualizethe incoming data so for this part we havent explored it that much but judging from thepreliminary successes we predict this has a huge potential and if properly worked uponthis can be easily integrated with standard or traditional iot based technologies evenin smart homes smart offices smart buildings transportation and everything so your decisionmaking what we are proposing you do the decision making at the server end we just transmitteddata from the smartphone over the network to the remote servernow before beginning ah i would like to just brush up on a few things so i hope you allknow that your smart phones are built in with certain sensors more specifically you haveyour accelerometers which are in every smartphone higher end smartphones will also have compassand a gyroscope so compass or magnetometer it will give you magnetic readings with respectto the true north and your gyroscope will give you the orientation of your smartphoneso for example your accelerometer will give me the readings of accelerations so supposein case of certain jerks like this smartphone is traveling with you so in case of certainjerks this accelerometer will generate higher impulse response in case ofgyroscope if your smartphones orientation changes even if there is a tilt or angle orany such other change the gyroscope will record this and your magnetometer which will be responsiblefor locating the direction you are moving with respect to the knotand additionally almost all smartphones are equipped with gps so you have four verybasic sensors found in almost all smartphones your extra meter gyroscope magnetometer andthe gps so using a combination of these four sensors and maybe the internal clock of thesensors internal clock of your smartphone and thenetwork attaching capability that means since your smartphone has already been enabled witha cellular connection or a wifi connection so you can choose either any of these twoconnections to transmit your data over the network to a remote location so this was aboutthe smartphones we are not going into the details how we are transmitting the data whichnetwork we are choosing for this for our demonstration purpose we are choosing a local wifi networkover which the server is also connected and the server is remotely located i will be usingmy desktop to access that server remotely and I will be trying to ah log in to my remoteserver via in android app so that the data can be transmitted directly so i have my androidapp i have connected it to the wifi network i open this app you just named it i raid soit has got three fields one is username one is the ip address of the server and one isthe port so if you remember that those lectures on iot with raspberry pi so we were also usingtwo i two ah basic things one was the ip address another was the port so over here also weare using these two the ip of the server in the port onto which your data will be uploadedand we have got two buttons one is initiate and one is stopso over at the server end i will start my python server so this web server was madeon a library function python library function for web sockets ah it it is known as autoban and using this auto ban and the twisted framework we created this web socket serverand similarly on this android phone the android programming for this application was doneusing the same manner so i give my server ip address asand the port name is same i will provide some username right so whenever i initiate my connectionfirst you look the server is actually expecting connections so whenever i initiate my connectionon the smartphone ah text message pops up connected and if you focuson the server end you will see that data is being logged onto the server so it has gotfew fields first is the date field on which the data is being collected next is the timethen third fields we have kept intentionally blank and for this demonstration purpose weare only logging the accelerometer values so if you see i give it jerky moments thevalues abruptly change on the server end additionally we open another link to the server and weopen a plotting function so on one thread the data is being uploaded over the networkfrom the smartphone remotely located smartphone on the other thread we are running a plottingfunctionso if you see on the screen now a plotting window pops upso since nothing is being plotted here i might need to change some parametersso now my data is being continuously logged on to the server so this is my plotting functionand in the plot program again you see these three lines these denote the accelerometerxy and z readings so if you see if i move my smartphone these lines go up and down sothis we have not tried filtering this data you are trying to plot it as it is cominginto the server there has not been any delay element added to it nothing just there allsensor values are being plotted so one thing you can derive from this is suppose your smartphoneis kept on a level area so you see your x axis y axis are more or less on the same planenearby each other and the z z axis gives a reading of ten this so this basically signifiesit is at certain distance from the ground right it is not at the zeroth position orthe same as x and y axis so whenever i change my maybe i tilt my phone if you see on thescreen the blue line goes up that means the x axis of the smartphone changes right nowwhenever i tilt up the phone in this manner you see my z axis goes down so it is muchmore nearer to the ground whereas my y axis goes up right so y-axis reading has changedso basic primary application which can be derived from this is maybe this can be usedas a level tester to check whether your levels are correct or not whether you are maybe youare supposed to put everything for parallel to the ground but you need some kind of leveltesting device which can tell you the measurementsso this may be one potential application other potential applications may include using thesesensors and combining them with various machine learning algorithms so for that you need aprior or historical data on which your various machine learning algorithms will be trainedso for supervised learning on the basis of that you can go for activity detection alsothis is only just monitoring of activities we are not giving out any kind of intelligencewhether this phone is ok or not whether a person holding this phone is sitting downor standing upright or lying down so those kinds of things can be additionally addedto this framework to make it more robust more reliable and much more functional so one isbasic activity monitoring another application can be which can be very useful is fall detectionlike we discussed in the previous lecture for medical ah patient monitoring you needfall detection approaches you need emergency alert approaches and so on so maybe usingthis you can detect a fall and after a fall has been detected various emergency servicescan be alerted you can even provide a feedback from the server after a fall has been detectedthe server will ask the phone user whether you have actually fallen or not so that maybe miscommunication from the sensor or that may have been due to an accidental jerk orsudden bump so if the user is in a condition to respond then it is fine so user says noif the user is not in the condition to respond so maybe something has gone wrong and emergencyservices hospitals relatives can be alertedso these are some of the basic implications and applications which can be developed usingthis framework in this approach so its actually limited by the by the users imagination whatelse can be done so i hope this has been useful to you thank you
