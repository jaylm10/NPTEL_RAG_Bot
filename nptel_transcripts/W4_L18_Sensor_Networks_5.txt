so finally we come to the last lecture of the series on sensor networks so here basicallyi would like to highlight some of the concepts of mobility so more specifically i would liketo explain the concept of mobile sensor networks so let us first look at the static variantsometimes it is also known as the stationary sensor network so here basically as the namesuggests the nodes are stationary or static so they do not move once deployed they willmaintain their positions at later instants of time as well so the advantage is basicallyit is easier to deploy sensor nodes in a stationary sensor network the nodes can be placed inan optimized manner then it there maintenance of the topology is easier and so on and soforth the disadvantage is that if there is a failure in the static sensor network thenit is likely that that point of failure can partition the network into two or more fragmentstwo or more partitionsso it is quite likely that there can happen and particularly if it is a critical nodeso in that node failing means that you know it is likely to partition the network so onepart of the network will not be able to talk with another part of the network and topologycannot be changed automatically is also another disadvantage of a stationary sensor networkso let us consider a state stationary sensor network as shown in this particular slideso we have these red colored nodes as points of failure because if this particular nodedies for one reason or other for example the hardware in it has failed it has stopped functioningor maybe that ah ah maybe ah the you know the battery battery that was powering thatparticular node it is exhausted so what is going to happen as a consequencethese nodes are positioned in such a way that these network partitions will be created sothree network partitions would be created if these two nodes fail so as a consequencewhat is going to happen is that we would have three partitions or three split ups of thenetwork due to these points of failure so what is the solution what is the solutionso one way to address this is to have some node maybe some external node external tothis particular network or among these if we can have one of these nodes mobile nodeswhich can move then what it can do is one of these nodes let us say this particularnode can come and take the position of these red colored node and this network will bejoined these partitions will be joined likewise maybe this node can come over here and likewisethese two partitions can be joined so these three partitions can be joined ifsome of these nodes one of these nodes is mobile so we have a mobile wireless sensornetwork which is basically a sensor network [a sation/a stationary] a stationary sensornetwork conceptually integrated with a mobile ad hoc network you know so this is not physicallyintegrated conceptually so take the features of mobile ad hoc networks take the few featuresof stationary sensor networks put them together and then you get the mobile wireless sensornetworks and ah as we know that manets mobile ad hoc networks are infrastructure less andinfrastructure less so basically what happens is the topology [bas/basically] basicallybecomes dynamic dynamically changing topologies that basically invites following propertieslike self configuring self healing self optimizing self protecting and so on so these have tobe there these are infrastructure less networks these do not have any centralized entity whichwill control the network management functions so this self job properties basically aregoing to take effect so this is what i was telling you ah littlelittle while back so mobile wireless sensor networks are basically a conceptual integrationof manets with wireless sensor networks so components of a mobile wireless sensor networkone is the mobile sensor node the nodes themselves could be mobile so these nodes we have a sinkthese nodes can move all around the sink so the sensor nodes these mobile sensor nodesthey would be sensing some physical parameters from the environment like the way it is shownover here so this node this red color node is sensing some physical parameter aroundthe environment so they sense the physical parameters from the environment when thesenodes come in close proximity of the sink they would deliver the data as shownso in this particular figure as we can see what happens is these two nodes they havecome within thus within the communication range of the sink node and once they comeinto the communication range of the sink node they would deliver the ah the sense data somaybe they have sense that data somewhere outside this range then they have moved andthen they dump that data once they come into the proximity of the sink node then we havethe mobile sink which moves in order to collect data from the sensor nodes the sink itselfthis we know so these sensor nodes in the earlier situation in the earlier example wehad considered that the sensor nodes can move here actually in this particular figure weshow that the sensor nodes are all stationary the sink node can move and can collect datafrom each of these sensor nodes then we can have data mules future mobileand these are like external entities which collects the data from the sensor nodes goesto the sink and delivers the collected data from the different sensor nodes so this mulecan go in close proximity to each of these red colored nodes and thereafter once it hasyou know finished collecting the data from these red colored nodes it will come in theclose proximity of the sink node and will deliver the message to the messages all thesemessages to the sink node now this mobile sensor network it can be usedeither in the terrestrial environment maybe by fitting sensors to robotic devices or canbe used in the aerial environment flying sensor networks for example the sensors the nodesthemselves they fly or it can be an underwater sensor network that means that the sensorsare fitted to underwater mobile devices like autonomous ah underwater vehicles rovers andso on so the examples could be to monitor the marine life or water quality so we haveuse of underwater mobile sensor networks which can autonomously automatically sense and remotelysend send the sensed parameters of different things such as the sea level water level soyou know ah water quality ah marine life ah and so on and so forth terrestrial wirelessmobile sensor networks sensor nodes typically deployed over land which can be linked withauvs that means the autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles and the applications would be wifewildlife monitoring surveillance object tracking and so on and the aerial version i told youwhere the nodes they fly so when they fly they sense and they form a network throughwhich the data are ah sent to the surface stationso the typical examples is unmanned aerial vehicles fitted with sensors applicationsinclude surveillance multimedia data gathering and so on so what can be mobile what can bemobile in a mobile sensor network we can have different types of examples of mobile entitiesfrom daily life one is the humans humans can be mobile and the mobility of humans are unpredictablefor example if somebody is walking with ah the cell phone on and then we want to gatherthe information of the cell phone then it is unpredictable to ah you know so it is unpredictablehow the know how the human being is going to move and consequently it is unpredictableto ah predict the mobility of the cell phone for vehicles for example sensors are typicallyused in cars and different modern day vehicles so that becomes vehicular sensor network wherethese vehicles are fitted with different sensors the sensed data from the different geographicallocations and transmit to the road side unit and then we have the mobile [robo/robots]robots which are controllable sensor nodes that collect data by predefined instructionsand deliver the data to a specific unit human centric sensing is possible because of theuse of smartphones and pdas which nowadays are equipped with several sensors typicallyeven up to like several sensors there are lot of smartphones so these sensors couldbe like accelerometer sensor gyroscope sensor and so on which are commonly available inthe modern day smartphones and pdas so miniaturization and proliferation of suchdevices give rise to new sensing paradigm such as participatory sensing people centricsensing and opportunistic sensing participatory sensing in participatory sensing a crowd agroup of people each having their smartphones equipped with sensors turn on their respectivesensors in their mobile phones and then consequently what is going to happen is we are going toform a human centric sensor network a human centric mobile sensor network then we havethe people centric sensing very similar to the example that i just told you so ah basicallyyou know the previous example i had talked about using peoples people moving so a everyyou know people they can also sense you know we have eyes ears etcetera so through whichwe can also [sens/sense] sense the people can also sense so that becomes people centricsensing and then we have opportunistic sensing which basically is that peripheral a particularnode moves in that in a in a to a different location then opportunistically it is goingto sense and then opportunistically it is going to deliver the message if another nodecomes ins proximity so the basic idea is that humans carry theirdevices and move around sensors embedded with the devices record the readings and the sensoryreadings are then transmitted there are three distinct roles played by humans one is thesensing of the targets second is the sensing of the operators and third is the acting asa data source now for human centric sensing there are differentchallenges challenges with respect to the energy of the devices then participants selectionprivacy of users and so on so i already explain to you the concept of participatory sensingwhich was proposed by burke et al in two thousand six as you can see that it is not a very longor ah you know old concept and here basically we are talking about distributed sensing bydevices carried by humans and the goal is not just to collect the data but allow commonpeople to access the data and share the knowledge delay tolerant networks basically you knowfrom one point to another the sense data will take lot of time to get delivered comparedto the regular time so with this we come to an end of this seriesof lectures on sensor networks we have seen that sensor networks are very much attractiveand more importantly sensor network i would think personally to be the most effectivemost important tool for building internet of things and we have ah covered ah the differentaspects of sensor networks in detail there is a separate ah ah nptl course which is onwireless ad hoc and sensor networks where we discuss about the details of sensor networksin ah in a in in depth so we come to an end of all these lectures on sensor networks forinternet of things
