in this lecture and a subsequent few we are going to go through some of the basics onthe networking aspects of internet of things so the first thing that we need to understandis that iot has evolved a lot so starting from basic research basic fundamental researchand innovation there has been different other types of innovation which are dik throughah which are disruptive and some of the other innovations which are sustaining in natureso in terms of basic research there has been lot of research on ah the nanotechnology theuse of nanotechnology the use of quantum [teletransport/ah teleportation] ah teleportation quantum teleportationbasically means that how ah the different information at the atomic level is sent fromone point to another so is transported from one point to anotherat the atomic level and nanotechnology ah it involves things like nanoiot nanonodesnanonetworking nodes ah nanosensor nodes and ah nanonetworks that means at the nanoscaleforming a network which can be for different purposes nanonetworks are used for differentpurposes ah in the human inside the human body at the molecular level nanonetworks canbe used so like this at the nanoscale and ah for quantum ah ah ah communication therehas been lot of ah advertisements ah that has been done ah for ah involving ah basicinnovations basic research innovations so this is one likewise ah for ah semanticinteroperability there has been lot of research on semantic in for interoperability for examplelet us see that a temperature sensor it might be given the data as temp another temperaturesensor as temperature another temperature sensor the third one st so there has to beinteroperability between all these different colossians but they are all different to thesame temperature right so this is basically taken care of by things like semantic interoperabilitythere has been lot of research on this one this particular aspect then energy harvestingagain there has been lot of research ah you know energy harvesting through different renewableah sources ah such as wind energy solar etcetera etcetera how these can harvest you know howthese deferent renewable sources ah from these how energy can be harvested to power the differentnodes and iot these are very small powered you know small sized nodes with very [la/limited]limited power so energy harvesting is very crucial it playsa crucial role in the sustenance of these networks so ah there has been lot of workon this one also and this has been like you know these aspects for example there has beenlot of brick through innovation on these ah then disruptive innovation ah for examplevirtual reality augmented reality you know so these are all like ah you know involvementof these an incorporation into the iot network ah there has been lot of ah ah research ahon on this particular front and ah things like cloud ah big data these are like sustainingtechnologies for iot again there has been lot of work on ah these technologies ah aswell ah now when we talk about iot if we think about iot what we have we have these differentthings ah ah which as i said in one of the previous lectures is these things are fittedah ah these are basically physical objects once again so these physical objects are fittedwith different sensors and these sensors basically ah sense different physical phenomena thatare occurring around them so these sensor fitted things sensors actuatorsand different other emirate devices ah these these are one component of the iot so butthese become the different nodes in the network these are the individual nodes in the networkso then what we have is these nodes they have to communicate with one another and the informationthat is sensed by one of these sensors fitted to this nodes this information from the sensorand the other sensors these are taken and are sent to the other sensor nodes the destinationnodes so how is that turn first these information have to flow through the local network andthen if the destination intended destination is outside this local network then it is sentthrough the internet typically if it is if we are talking about an iot which is basicallyinternet ah based iot then basically it is going to flow through the internet or someother wide area network and finally it is going to arrive at the intended destinationnode and from there may be there can be some there can be some ah at that point actuallythere can be some analytic engine which is running on some backend server ah those couldbe there and from that point from the decision from these analytics they can run on thisservers ah decisions about actuation could be madeso what we see is from sensors to actuators through the local area network the internetinvolving ah you know [black/backend] backend services analytics ah which includes againsome you know high end processing at deferent servers ah and different [complec/complex]complex algorithms execution of different [call/complex] algorithms ah which are basedon may be machine learning ah neural networks and so on and so forth these are all requiredso so basically you know what happens is we basically can conceive ah of an iot as a verycomplex system involving sensors actuators ah networks local area wide area internetand ah ah different servers different algorithms machine learning and so on all executing ahtogether to make the system function as as one single entity so going back we have ahin this local network as you are saying then we have the internet we have the backend ahservices and finally the applications that i have been servedso these are the different basic components of iot so this is the scenario that i wasreferring to earlier so what we have we have these different things we have these differentthings these things could be ah like you know different ah physical objects which are fittedwith different sensors these things could be telephones ah lightning systems ah couldbe cameras could be different other scanner sensors like ah the temperature sensor andso on and these things are able to communicate with one another with the help of wirelesstechnologies like zigbee bluetooth wifi and so on so as you can see that this wirelessbasically helps these different devices to talk to one another and this information fromthese devices they will fro through a local network and from a local network they willgo through the internet to ah ah to the ah you know these data are basically sent tothe backend services involving different servers processors and so on and so forth for runningdifferent analytics and then based on that different devices can be actuated ah um ahyou know ah may be a pump ah this is an example that i gave earlier in a previous lecturebasically for agricultural purposes the use of iot a pump might be started might be actuatedbased on the data that is received from the sensor nodes and based on analytics are runat the different servers ah a ah in a that are involved in the backend service processingso in terms of the functional components of iot so one of the very important things isbasically interaction interaction not only with the physical environment by this differentsensors but also interaction and communication with the different devices ah ah ah that meansa different nodes in the iot in the iot network then comes the processing so processing andanalysis of the different functioning and the operations that taken place so processingof that ah data the processing of operations ah so this is another component ah the thirdfunctional component is basically the interaction interaction typically with the internet ahand because you know at present most of the times the most of the iot implementationsare still using the internet so it is all you know internet powered iot implementationsso ah internet interaction is a ah is one of the very important ah ah components ofah building iot then we have the web services web services machine to machine communicationand so on so basically it what is going to happen earlier most of the so when you talkabout a web technology typically we are talking about human to machine communication you knowweb service we are talking about ah you know ah some machine ah ah sending ah or some ahsome ah equipment basically sensing and sending that data to another machine for further processingor machine to machine communication is involved and offering different services so one machineoffer some services to another machine and so on so so like this ah and this is basicallyyou know this sort of thing in a iot scenario is taken care of ah ah um ah typically andthen we have ah the integration of different applications services and the user interfaceto access the iot that is another component so there has to be is a user interface a humaninterface to accessing the iot network or the iot ah you know mega network so lookingat this particular figure i would like to try to clarify how the iot implementationis typically done and it can be done to achieve different application needs so this is a figurewhich shows that we have different sensors processors and radio it refitted to each ofthis devices or the sensor nodes or the sensor motes or the iot motes as you may want tocall them so these motes they talk to one another but these different sensor nodes thesedifferent sensor nodes they are basically within the jurisdiction or the domain of thegateway so the gateway is basically tasked to assign different local locally unique addressesto these different nodes to these different iot nodes and the gateway basically takescare of the local addressing within that particular local area network so from the that pointall the data can flow through a proxy server if internet access is required so it willgo through the internet then a web socket and from the web socket it goes through acloud server that means this is where lot of analytics and backend processing takesplace and based on that the actuation based on the analytics and the infer ant says thatand run from the sensed data actuation of different devices can take placefor example lighting a particular lamp could be the actuation of that particular lamp wehave different interdependencies that are evolved in the implementation of iot so wehave if we look at iot from another prospective or we have we have sensors we have actuatorsand a bunch of other things that are they are in between has shown in this particularfigure so this is basically the entire spend of these different embedded devices so thesensors basically sense the data and that data is basically serving the applicationrequirements and then we have an operating system and a power management unit which basicallyyou know does things like duty cycling of the sensors the how much the sensors ah youknow how much time we are going to be active or how much time they are going to be in thesleep state how to power them how to power them because these are very small sized youknow very resource staved sensors so ah and the the basically the power unit in thesesensor nodes these are very small ah in size so basically consequently what happens isthese embedded devices they themselves are very resource staved so we have ah a verypower management unit which basically takes care of power management as a whole how muchpower is require for how long it is going to power then what are the ways to harvestenergy if at all it can be harvested and ah how much power consumption is going to takeplace at different points of time can it be can it be optimized ah different points ofah operation ah on so on and so forth and a as you can see over here there after wehave these different radios involving bluetooth zigbee six low pan wifi ethernet and ah lowrange ah basically wifi ah so these are the different you know radiosthat can help ah in communicating the data ah that is sensed ah ah ah onward to othernodes these these basically these [di/different] different radio technologies can help in the[com/for] for the communication purpose so alongside we also have things like virtualmachines which the takes care of the virtualization of the nodes we have the web ah we have ahyou know different things like http client mqtt client coap client so these are the oncemqtt coap we are going to talk next in in the ah subsequent lectures so ah ah that willmake our understanding clearance but these are like no different application level ahprotocols that are used for functioning of these different iot devices and finally comesthe actuator verticals so we have the sensors we have different applicationsoperating system power management radios virtual machines web and then we have these actuatorsall together which forms the embedded systems the embedded devices now you let us now lookat the service orientation the service oriented architecture of ah ah iot so in the iot ifhere what we have at these different layers the sensing layer the network layer the servicelayer and the interface layer so we have four different layers and as the name suggestssensing layer basically takes care of sensing through different rfid tags sensors and soon so fourth and then data are sensed are acquired and so on are sent to the next layerhigher up which is the network layer the network layer basically ah serves sensor networkssocial networks you know different other networks and data bases internet and so on that isthe network layer then what we have we have the service layer which deals [mo/mostly]mostly with the service delivery ah such as ah service ah division service integrationah service ah ah you know service repository ah service ah logic ah by business logic andso on so all these different things that i involved with the offering of the servicesto support the business functions then we have the interface layer we have theapplication frontend we have ah a contract interface and application apis so so [these/this]this becomes the interface layer and when we have the security issues which basicallyspan all these different ah layer verticals ah sorry layer horizontals so in terms ofah ah the categorization of iot it can be categorized into two one is the consumer iotwhich is what typically most of the people tempt to use and these are ah here basicallythese different devices they communicate ah with another ah ah ah through these localnetworks and it can be you know find a further communication you can also take place overthe internet as well so depending on the requirements either local or ah through the internet thenwe have the local communication which is typically done via bluetooth zigbee or wifi and ah sobasically this local communication is constraint within the bounds of or within the domainof the iot gateway so ah this is consumer iot then ah we have the industrial iot whichis basically ah ah quite similar to the consumer iot but ah the application ah ah uh the applicationinterest is in the industrial sector so we are talking about manufacturing industrieswith different machines with these machines are fitted with different iot devices theytogether become the iot device they have different sensors and so on feature there which canthe node as a whole can communicate with other machines and so on so this becomes the industrialiot and ah basically there are different communication that takes place between the different nodesas well as different industry specific technologies now we talk about iot gateways ah so thisis what i told you that ah in a local network you have this locally unique addresses ahand that are they are ah within that local area network iot network and so ah ahso these local addresses basically they take care of ah ah the addressing of the ah thedifferent nodes now so what are these gateways doing so the gateways basically take careof the addressing but then ah in this is what the gateway structure looks like so this isah what ah is here so we have the local network on one side of the gateway we have the globalnetwork on the other side of the gateway and this is where the the gateway this is howthe gateway looks like so the gateway has ah and functions different tasks such as switchingah routing protocol conversion firewall and vpn services security as a whole and processingso this is what a gateway does and the gateway with the local network and the global networkcommunicate via the wired or wireless channels ah and so on so this is how the iot gatewaysfunction different associated technologies of iot ah involving big data cloud smart gridinternet of vehicles ah that means you know different vehicles on the road ah ah are fittedwith different iot devices which can communicate with one another and different intelligenceabout the route traffic conditions about the offering different ah road side services ahah can be make possible with the help of internet of vehicles then we have the machine to machinecommunication where one machine talks to another without any human interventionwe have telemedicine ah offering ah you know offering health care services to the demotehospitals demote health care centers and so on ah cps server physical systems we havethree g four g five g we have ah sdn ah and so on so these are the different associatedtechnologies which together ah make ah ah ah iot which together are used to ah deliveriot solutions now you know if we try to to make a side by side comparison between ahthe iot stack and web stack we will see that more or less the application layers remainthe same for both iot as well as the as well as the web so conceptually these applicationlayers these different layers communication layers and application layers that communicationlayers remaining the same between iot and web but what is different is that we havea new set of protocols that are used over here so the new set of protocols and additionallyin iot unlike in the case of web things such as different types of management managementof the network management of the power management of different other resources these are alladditionally taken care of in the iot node ah in the iot stack ah which is not availablein the case of the web and this is very much required because you know in the case of iotwe are talking about heavily resource constraint nodes and this heavily resource constraintnodes basically required management network management in terms of energy in terms ofprocessing in terms of data and so on and so forthso there are different key technologies that basically help iot survive we have the futureinternet knowledge aggregation yeah obtain through data assignation data data collectionprocessing and ah analysis then we have the different standards we have the sensor networkswe have the communication we have cloud computing we have discovery services nanoelectronicsembedded systems software system integration and last but not the least what is over hereon top is the security on privacy issues so security on privacy issues are per amountin iot because there are heavy concerns ah because you know we are dealing with resourceconstraint nodes with communication constraints bandwidth constraints processing constraintsenergy constraints and so on so these nodes become very much valuably valuable to differenttype of attacks different types of security breaches and also because iot systems arevery much detail intensive there is lot of information that frozen through the networkas a consequence of which the privacy of the individuals of the organizations might beat stack so security and privacy and trust also which is not mentioned over here theseare very much important ah to power iot technologies there are different types of challenges securitiesscalability energy efficiency bandwidth management interfacing interoperabilityso when we are talking about interfacing it is typically we are referring to device interfacingso different you know one device ah talking to another device may be these devices donot belong to the same vender they are not running the same stack they are not followingthe same standard and so on so then comes consequently then comes the interoperabilityissue how to make these devices talk to one another how the different protocols the differentdevices the different algorithms they are going to hand shake with one another so likethis this is another challenge which is typical of iot implementations then we have data storagean analytics and complexity management with tools such as sdn so asdn basically helpsin ah addressing the com ah the complexity of ah systems by decupling ah the controlplane from the detect plane of the networks different considerations and they are forbuilding iot one is that will to have a straight network architecture which can be used bydifferent iot implementations so there has to be a governing network architecture numbertwo hardware requirements and cost are important ah you know what type of communication hardwareare going to be used ah and different devices in the costs that are involved and due tothe presence of numerous applications of iot enabled devices a single networking platformmay not be sufficient to address and the needs of the consumer or the iot deviceso this is another the third consideration that has to be taken into ah ah account whilebuilding the iot systems then we have the complexity of the networks ah you know ifthe number of nodes in the network increases then whether the in the solution because ifthe system is going to be ah ah you know sustainable whether it can be scaled up or not ah thenwe have the interface among ah interference among the different devices this is very watchin vital in ah in any network interference is ah a crucial issue and particularly iotnetworks involve lot of large number of typically densely deployed nodes and these nodes becausethe at you know typically ah wireless power ah by wifi or bluetooth or zigbee and so onso interference between these different ah ah communication between these different nodesthat at the ah corresponding radios and so on is possible so how do you handle it networkmanagement as a whole as i was tell in earlier involving ah you know energy management involvingcomputation management involving communication management involving service management andinfrastructure management and so on so network management as a whole then heterogeneity inthe networks heterogeneity in terms of the devices standards the protocols the algorithmsand so on so how do you handle because iot devices unlike traditional internetiot networks come in different ah you know come from different venders different devicescoming from different venders different devices using different algorithms these differentprotocols being used and so on so so all these ah basically invite ah dealing with the issueof heterogeneity lot of heterogeneity is involves so how heterogeneity is taken care of andprotocol organization and standardization so ah within the network so how the differentprotocols can be standardized ah so that a device running one protocol can talk to anotherdevice and so on the different wireless networks are used issues such as traffic managementload management ah then variations in the different wireless network forms for examplewireless [pa/personal] personal area network w turn versus wireless body area network interoperabilityi have already mentioned just a while back then network management and overlay networkso ah ah so basically you know the overlay network takes care of some kind of a virtualizationof the physical devices on you know so ah and and one type of this physical virtualdevices and the networks and overlay is created this is basically the overlay networkscalability in involving flexibility within the internet ah then integration of differentiot devices there are many manufactured using different standards may be in the using differentah you know vender specific ah ah protocols ah so iot integration ah is ah a very complexissue ah which basically dictates the scalability of the system large scale deployment issuesah and real time connectivity of billion centurions of devices with this we come to an end ofah this lecture on ah ah on the basics of iot networking ah um ah but this is just afirst part we are going to cover ah many other ah issues involving ah the networking aspectsof iot in the subsequent lectures and from ah there we can understand from this subsequentlectures we can understand how forming an iot is very complex what are the differentprotocols individual protocols that are how they are did may not be a single isolatedor or a single ah thread head let us say ah um ah one protocol ah for iot as a whole butthere as all these individual protocols settled there so how that can be taken care of andfor how can architecture be sent up between these different iot devices manufactured bydifferent venders so these like this actually there are different complexities that i haveinvolved so we have really talk about that in the subsequent lecturesthank you
