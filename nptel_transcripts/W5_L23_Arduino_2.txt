hai now we will continue with the introduction to arduino programming this will be the secondpart and the continuation of the previous one so we will cover the basic topics theoperators in arduino control statements loops arrays strings the mathematics library randomnumber interrupts and the example program which will be bit complicated than the previousone so basic operators as normal c c plus plus or python programming or other languagesyou have the basic equal to plus minus ah multiplication division module division operatorsthen comparison operators ah we have equal to not equal to less than greater than andall those operators then we have boolean operators bitwise operators and compound operators movingon to control statements these will basically cover the various checking and looping partsso a normal if else statement in arduino we start off with the if statement so if we havea condition and within this curly braces if the statement condition is true if else ifanother statement condition is true or else if none of the above statements are true thenthis loop will execute moving on to switch case you have switch and choices you havecase option one and statement and then a break function after each case so case option twois statement two then again a break and so on and at the end you have a default caseafter that we again have a break function then you have a conditional operator we willavoid using conditional operators such as these in arduino so it is condition if itis true it will execute statement one else it will execute statement two these kind ofstatement operators are best avoided during arduino programmingso in loops you have the basic for loop then you have the while loop you have a do whileloop these are pretty common examples you have a nested loop that is a loop inside anotherloop you can have many nested loops inside each other so you have an infinite loop so(Refer Time: 03:00) to run an infinite loop for example you all you need you develop asystem in which ah and which you need to turn on and off a light or a led or any other deviceinfinitely as long as the devices on your system is checking so a recall from the lastlecture ah which i showed the blinking led exampleso you can see if you put it inside an infinite loop as long as the ardiuno board is poweredit will keep on blinking so your functions can be made more complicated instead of ledsyou can have motors instead of ah motors you can have actually cameras mounted on the motorsand they keep on rotating you have you can have a multitude of sensors which are interfacewith the cameras and the motors so you can for example you can build the security systemswhich will keep on running as long as your processor board is fine and the power (ReferTime: 04:00) is being supplied you can always connected to a battery supply to generatepower for it then you have arrays arrays are collection of elements having homogeneousdata type and which are stored in adjacent memory locations the conventional startingindex is zero in arduino so declaration of array you just ah start off with the datatype it maybe a arrays of integers so int array name and the size so for example intarray this a variable name array five it will allocate five phases for your array then youcan have a alternate declarations suppose int array and this blank bracketequal to within this curly braces you have zero one two three four so these will be automaticallystored in (Refer Time: 05:00) this array then again you have enter a five you can just putin three variable three values inside this array and the remaining will be kept blankmaybe for later use you can fill those also then you have multi dimentional array declarationssame as previous one you have the data type then array name then the dimentionals forthe first dimentional let it be n one n two n three so for example ah if you want to declarean array for a image which normally normal rgb image so you havethree channels red green and blue so each image has will have ah two d structures rowsand columns and there will be a depth for each r g and b so maybe for those types ofdata we have int array row column height (Refer Time: 06:00) so then moving on to string stringis an array of characters with null as the termination declaration is maybe using charchar stringhere str is the array so abcd so this is stored in str char str four and you can individuallyaccess each ids you can store a b c or maybe zero so this using the same location if youwant to individually stored in different locations so ah sorry come in the same location if youkeep on storing this the last one will be last character stored will be updated otherwill be overwritten if you want to store in different locations you just change it fromstring it from string zero str one str two str three and so on (Refer Time: 07:00) soyou will have consecutive a b c zero side by side these locations ah another thing youcan also you also have a data type string so string str equal to abc will give you abcall together you dont have to store in individual locations ah so this is one of the benefitsof using arduino so some commonly used ah functions of stringso str to upper case ah point to note is to upper case t u and c are caps so this hasto be follow strictly ah since this is part of the syntax so it changes all the charactersof string to upper case and then you have string str dot replace string one and stringtwo (Refer Time: 08:00) so string one if it is sub string of str then it will be replacedby str two then str dot length it writtens the length of the string without consideringthe null character then another commonly used library is the math library to apply the mathfunctions the math dot h header must be initially called otherwise you wont be able to accessthese functions so some of the common functions are cos which is in double radian and sintan floating absolute fabs right floating modso double value one and double value two so you have two values and f mod will give youthe modular division and the result point will be a floating point number then continuingwith the math library again you have exp which [signify/signifies] signifies the (Refer Time:09:00) exponential function you have log function this will give the national logarithm of thevalue then you have log ten then you have square function power function first argumentis the base the second argument signifies the power then another commonly used exampleis random number so one of the functions of this random numberis random seed so the syntax is random seed s capital you need to focus on this one becauseah this is the inbuilt syntax for arduino so random seed int v it reset the pseudo randomnumber generator with seed value v so you already the seed value is the starting pointfrom which the random number will initialize its function so (Refer Time: 10:00) you gavea starring value from it the random number will generate then random max i it gives therandom number within the range zero to max i then you have random mini and max i it givesthe random number within the range mini and max then moving on to interrupts you havean external signal interrupts these are basically an external signal for which the systems blocksthe current running process till receiving that signalso basically you have two types of interrupts one is hardware and another is software soi will give one example suppose here in a loop here ah waiting for a checking conditionwhether that checking condition holds true or not and maybe from an external source youare getting that that checking condition (Refer Time: 11:00) for example you have a buttonor a digital switch connected to a arduino board so whenever you are pressing that switchyour system will ah blink an led otherwise it will keep the led off so this may be consideredas a partially considered as an interrupt so this will be an external interrupt so asyou can see digital pin to interrupt and then the pin number it actually changes that digitalpin to the specific interrupt number then attach interrupt digital pin to interruptthen pin then isr then mode so isr is basically known as an interrupt service routine it hasto be defined explicitly so these are some of the more complicatedfunction so we will not focus on these interruption (Refer Time: 12:00) other ah complicationswe will just try to keep it as easy as possible so we will try to implement within this lecturewe will try to implement a basic rudimentary traffic control system so we need a arduinoboard three different leds some resisters maybe two twenty ohm or three thirty ohm anda few connecting jumper wires to connect the various components on the breadboard as youcan see from the previous as you remember from the previous example we connected inled with the arduino board the same process has to be repeated three times using differentcolored leds and at different pins so so in the last example we connected the led to pintwelve so maybe in this example we will connected to pin two three and four side by side so(Refer Time: 13:00) this is the sample sketch so as you can see tried to using void setupwe globally define a few value int r equal to two basically we are taking three colorsr g and b we are not giving b we are written yso r g and y red green and yellow so globally we are defining r as integer equal to twog equal to three y equal to four in within void setup we initialize the serial port atninety six hundred broad rate then pin mode we write r and the and output so as you canremember the first one was the actual pin on the arduino device and the second one wasthe mode either input or output so you are since your connecting leds will be obviouslyusing it as output so r is (Refer Time: 14:00) r was globally assigned as two so this willbe two and output so it translates to pin two will work as output and then digital writer low so this function will initially set the a value of pin two to zero so it willbe turned up the same process is repeated for pin three and pin four which connectedto the green and yellow leds now we define the function traffic so data type you havegiven as void so void traffic we digit ah so digital write g high that was g was definedas pin three so over here pin three becomes high then serial be over the serial port weprint (Refer Time: 15:00) green led on go so it since it simulates a traffic signalyou will have a go signal denoted by green a stop signal denoted by red and a wait signaldenoted by yellow so green leds when it switches on it signifies go this will be printed onthe serial port you can all obviously coming this out( then we induce a delay of five seconds usingthis command delay five thousand so if you remember from the previous example delay takesan input in the terms of millisecondsok one more thing this double slash it denotes commenting the character so whenever you putdouble slash in front of a statement it wont execute your compiler will skip theexecution next we go to digital write g low so whatis (Refer Time: 16:00) physically happening is at the start of the loop you have the greensignal is glowing then after five second delay the green signal is offthen the yellow signal goes high so your print again green led off yellow led on so the statusis wait then again a delay of five seconds then followed by digital write y or yellowas low and digital write r as high so your wait signal will turn off and the stop signalwill go high same thing is printed on the serial port then again you have a delay offive seconds then digital write r as low now you have all three leds turned off and yourserial print all off now within this void (Refer Time: 17:00) loop you call this trafficfunction so this traffic will iteratively run again and again and again till your deviceis powered and if call a delay of ten thousand that is ten secondsso your traffic signal loop will run once then stop for ten seconds then it will thewhole loop will once again and it will keep on goingso as you can see over here in the image the leds are glowing sequentially we will cometo that on the hands on the various outputs are printed on the terminal now if you comeback to the circuit part as you can see the code i showed youi have already made the code ready (Refer Time: 18:00) i have connected the arduinoboardso i have three differently colored leds red green and yellow i have three three thirtyohm registers i have a arduino uno and i have a bread board i will just connect these sequentiallygreen yellow red you must always remember this conventionthat the smaller pin is for ground the longer pin is for positive signal (Refer Time: 19:00)so lets check again this row is suppose to be groundsince ok the low is properly connected green is properly connected now across each ledwill put up a register three thirty ohm registerfirst of all sense in a breadboard these channels are fused so i will only need one signal singlesignal to connect to the arduino is this was negative part will connected to ground(Refer Time: 20:00) now if you remember the green was connected to pin three green wasassigned up in three in the code pin two was assigned to redand yellow was assigned pin four so now we have our connections readyso three wires for r g and y and one for the ground now if you go through the code againso you have globally declared r as pin two g as pin three and y as pin four so we havebeen implemented on the breadboard then (Refer Time: 21:00) serial port starting broad rateis ninety six hundred pin mode r g and y as outputs digital write r g and y as low thatis initially at the very beginning everything will be turned off and within void trafficyou switch on each led one at a time starting from green then yellow then red so this basicallywhat a traffic signal does so we will compile this codeyou see the code has been compiled without any errors i will check whether my board isconnected yes it is arduino uno the port is ok so the board and the ports are fine willupload the code or the sketch (Refer Time: 22:00) and the uploading partis complete so ah if you focus on the arduino board as you can see you have a reset buttonso it has already entered into the loop so we will push the reset button so that thecode execution starts from the very beginning you see the green led is glows on it willglow for five seconds followed by the yellow one we should again the low for five secondsand then it is followed by the red one which glows for five seconds all three turn offit will wait for ten seconds before going again into the loop that void traffic loopnow same thing if you focus on the serial monitoryou can see green leds is on go green off yellow on wait now yellow off red is on stop(Refer Time: 23:00) right so now everything is off so it will be wait for ten secondsthen again the loop starts from the green led so its actually not required to have aserial communication for this automatic traffic control signal but for the sake of debuggingi actually prefer this thing so you can actually when you connected your system to a pc youcan actually see which part of the loop your code or the hardware is executing so it helpsyou in debugging your code effectively so this is it for now ok thank you
