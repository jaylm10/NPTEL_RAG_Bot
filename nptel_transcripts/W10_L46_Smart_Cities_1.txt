this lecture is on smart cities and smart homes and here we are going to talk abouthow iot can help in building the smart cities and smart homes as you know that throughoutthe world and even in countries like india there is a lot of focus on building smartcities of course the scope of smart cities in each of these different countries is differentand the scope again depends on the priority areas of each of these countries and theirgovernment now for for instance in india since the last few years there have been a coupleof cities that have been identified and phase wise these cities have been given funds tobuild or to transform them as smart citiesso when we talked about smart cities what is it so in addition to the regular infrastructurethat is there in any city for example the urban infrastructure consisting of officebuildings residential areas hospitals schools transportation police and so on you also needsomething in addition to make the cities smart so what is this in addition let us talk aboutso smart means what smart means that it is in terms of the services that are given tothe respective stake holders of these cities so citizens citizens are able to do thingsin a better manner in an improved manner then usual and how is that made possible that ismade possible with the help of nothing but the ict technologies information and communicationtechnologies which also includes electronics embedded electronics different other advancedah ah topologies in electrical ah in a electrical sciences and so on so computers electronicsput together can make these cities smartso let me just take an example at the outset so first of all let us consider any smartcity so if we are talking about a smart city we need to have the basic components for exampletransport there has to be a railways there has to be hospitalsthere has to be schools there has to be let us say traffic controltraffic control waste management waste management ah banking then ahso like this these are some of the different things in a smart city right and one thingi have missed which is very much essential is the police so as you can see that we haveto transform all of these different components of any city to be smart so for which the technologyis that we have studied so far in the previous lectures will have to be taken help of sodefinitely will have to take help of sensors sensor networks sensor networks then actuatorsthen ah the different other communication technologies rfid nfc ah zwave and so andso forth so many different things that we have covered in all these previous lecturesof this course on iot so all these will have to be used in order to make this transformationso these are the different ict information and communication technologies that will haveto be used rightso so what is going to happen is in an iot environment there has to be lot of these interconnectivitiesthat have to be there so for you know although i am drawing these lines ah almost like randomlybut there has to be ah you know ah there has to be connectivity between all these differenttypes different blocks and so on ah for different good reasons and the reason could be likeoffering different services ah to citizens so services means that in a smart way peoplewould be able to do different things for example if it is a health care facility so from ahvery easily you know if something goes wrong let us say let us say with the school childin during the school hours very easily the hospital can be contacted not over telephoneany longer i mean of course the telephone connectivity the traditional ones would bethere but in addition you know there would be smart messaging and so on the ambulanceswould come there would be continuous monitoring over the ambulance of the child who is beingtransported to the hospital from the school parents would be automatically informed aboutthe status and so onso many things would be done seamlessly automatically and these are the different services thatare going to be offered and normally these services would have to be offered ah for thoseor to those who have subscribed for these services only to the subscribers these serviceswould have to be offered so whether it is on a paper you know on a on a payment basisor it will be free that depends on the implementation in the smart city but generally offering differentservices advance levels of services to different citizens is one of the most important coreobjectives of the development of smart citiesso let us move ahead and see that ah what else is there for us so as i was telling youbefore that in a smart city you have an urban system which ah uses different ict tools informationand communication tools which makes the infrastructure very interactive efficient and accessiblein an easier manner then before you know it it should be you know easily accessible infrastructureand the need for smart cities arose due to different things so first of all the thereis an ever growing urban population throughout the world it is not limited to any countrybut throughout the world there is an there is a rapidly growing urban population andat the same time the natural resources like coal ah ah you know ah and ah you know soin so many different ah natural resources that we all use these are depleting at fastrate so and at the same time there is change in climate change in environment all throughoutso all these basically necessitate the building of smart cities using advanced ict tools solet us draw some analogy when we talk about a human when we talk about a human humanshave the skeleton the skin the organs different types of organs brains nerves sensory organscognition and so on in the smart city as well in the same way has as a human has a skeletonskin and organs smart cities or rather any city rather any city has buildings industriespeople transportation logistics hospital police banks schools so these are there but on topof that if there is a human with ah skeleton skin and organs but no brains no nerves nosensory organs no cognition so you do not have you know life in that human you do nothave any life in that human so same analogy can be drawn you know analogously we can saythat in a smart city if you do not have embedded intelligence communication networks sensorstags software embedded in these different components and infrastructure of the citythe existing cities then it also doesnt have any life so to bring in life to the existingcities having buildings industries transportation police banks etcetera etcetera you need toembed ict which includes ubiquity in embedded intelligence digital communication networkssensors actuators tags different software doing different things in a smart way makingthese different devices to act in a smart way and so onso these are some of the application focus areas we have smart economy so because ofthe ever increasing competitiveness you need to improve you need to improve your infrastructurethe economy to make it smart so i will talk about that in more detail shortly now youneed to also improve the citizen participation in any good governance in any good governanceyou need to improve you need to increase the citizen participation and how is that possibleyou need to take help of the ict toolssocial and human capital you need to make the social and human capital also smarterby giving them different technologies different tools the ict tools then smart mobility toimprove the transportation with the help of ict with the help of ict you know making thetransportation smart smart mobility natural resources so smart environment you know sobasically you know you need to make your environment smart there should be less you know harmfulor toxic gas ah emissions or other sorts of waste ah disposals you know these would bea reduced and these should be done in a smart without basically effecting the environmentthat way conserving the natural resources smart living which would improve the overallquality of life of the citizens so these are some of the application focus areas of smartcitynow when a when we talk about smart city one of the most important things is smart economyso the economy has to be improved over what already exists so let us say that in any economywhat do you need in addition to the existing economic infrastructure like industry ah ofdifferent types and different other economic domains including even like schools hospitalsetcetera etcetera you also need to improve the economy by including by involving thegrowth of startups then indigenous disport ah diaspora and different founders of differenttechnologies all of these have to be there and they have to be interconnected they haveto be interconnected with different other components for example a venture capitalista venture capitalist have to be interconnected with them the international diaspora alongwith the indigenous diaspora then academic ah academia ah then ah public sector ah buyersworldwide buyers government agencies global mncs and so onso they they all have to be interconnected inter networked together not just at the connectivitylevel but so that this connectivity has to be there so that you know different typesof information different types of services are made available to each of these differentcomponents in a smart manner so they should be able to get these services whenever theyneed you know whenever there is an useful use case you know from the different componentsthey would be participating in order to improve the quality of fulfilment of the use caselet us talk about governance in governance there is at the core the government bodiesthe government offices and at the same time the citizens so these government agenciescitizens and officials government officials these are all core to any governance or anygovernment body now in addition you have all these peripheral ones like banking financereforms safety surveillance management public services emergency services and so onnow in a you know in a regular city what happens is typically traditionally they all they functionsort of in isolation there is some minimal connectivity between them but these are nota smart connectivity with the help of these ict tools so in a smart governance what isgoing to happen is they all are going to get connected they all are going to get connectedso let us say that the officials are not only going to get connected to these governmentagencies and citizens but also to the public services to the emergency services to thebanking to finances ah you know surveillance citizens you know so all these different typesof interconnectivities are going to be there so you have to make it possible in order tobuild a smart government systemlet us look further ahead and see what is there in ah for us so we have ah the smartpeople so when we talk about the citizens you know education health care populationoverall is at the core of the in of any city so and at the same time peripherally we havethe transportation the shopping banking connectivity media safety ah current affairs social networksthese are also like peripheral things so they all again have to be interconnected so thatfrom any component it it should be made possible to access ah information from other componentsof course there has to some kind of policies of data you know floating across but generallythis has to be made possible so that the citizens get the information the citizens get the servicesfrom any of these components whenever they need and that has to be again identified ina smart city that has to be that need has to be identified intelligently with the helpof cognition with the help of the different software the intelligence that is embeddedin to the systemsmart mobility likewise we already have a addition to the population we have the citiesthe localities and so on so you need to have interconnectivity with the other peripheralcomponents like vehicular networks transportation logistic emergency response railways airwaysyou know electric vehicles and so on so these sort of because let me just talk about a aa use case with respect to this so let us say that i want to go in a city from pointa to point b not just in the city we can even go from one city to another city as well onecity to another citynow what should happen is that the information should be made available in such a way i amjust giving a simple use case that let us say that i want to book a train from cityx to city y or point x in a city to point y in a city and let us say that the road thati am going to take is going to be very much congested or it is going to be ah very expensivethat particular root is going to be very expensive or maybe you know there are ah ah you knowthere are different other reasons for which you can consider thealternative options the alternative options would be that very easily instead of takinga train one could also get other options like taking a bus you know or taking another ahyou know electric vehicle or you know ah and so on and these again the bus the train etceterathese also have to be connected with the police the police and the emergency vehicles so emergencyvehicles because for obvious reasons if there is some kind of an accident etcetera etceteraunder that the emergency response team should be able to get information on the fly youknow so whenever it is required they should be able to get a a information and then theaction also has to initiate with the help of these ah tools in a smart mannerthen the we have the smart environment where in addition to the government agencies localitiespopulation there there are components like waste management waste disposal you know agricultureyou know forest monitoring pollution monitoring disaster management green constructions smartenergy these all these different components inter internetworked together interconnectedtogether in a smart living kind of scenario you we have this we have the localities populationah serving ah servicing agencies these interconnected with all these different other peripheralcomponents as you can see in front you in this particular slideso let me just give another example before we go further ahead let us consider a smartsmart city where where we have a a school we have a school so apparently or rather traditionallyin a school in any school what you know the school specifically function in isolationthe school specifically function in isolation in the sense that you know they do not reallyhave to interact with the other components of a city that much but in a smart city whatis going to happen is we have these other other components like transports railwayswe have the hospitals we have traffic control we have the police we have ah did i say hospitalsah hospitals i have already said like this actually we have different other things inthis smart city so you know what is going to happen is ifyou have this kind of inter connectivity or even between police and transport you knowschools and hospitals hospitals and transport you know railways and this thing and likethis then let us say that when a school child from his home he wants to come to a schoolhe has information about the different forms of transport that he can take and let us sayin an un event in an ah you know in a ah in an emergency ah in the road while going ahthere is some kind of accident or whatever then correspondingly the police has to beinformed and also ah the traffic control also has to take over and ah also the hospitalshave to be informed so that the child can get health facilities on the road and thesame thing can happen inside the school as well once this once the child is inside theschool the same thing can happen so as you can understand now so this was from the educationsector school education sector like this actually there are different other reasons why smartah cities have become very popular now we have the different focus areas we haveah smart homes smart parking lots in a smart home situation we need to have i will talkabout smart homes in more detail later on but in a smart home situation we have thehealth monitoring done in a smart way at home this you know the medical data made availableto the doctors whenever there is a health criticality the corresponding house physicianwould be informed the the physician can take requisite action based on the severity ofah severity or criticality of the ah of the health of the patient ahso smart health monitoring then conservation of resources with respect to electricity waterfuel you know so you know we should ah we can have a smart home where you know the watertap will be turned off if you know it is automatically it will be turned off may be with the helpof ict tools whenever it is not being used may be accidentally if i have turned on thetap the water tap it will be turned off similarly with the fuel consumption or conservationas well and ah like that and security and safety is very much paramount in a smart homesecurity and safety for obvious reasons i do not need to elaborate on these but safetyat home security at home you know prevention of burglars from breaking breaking into thehouse and so on so so like that actually there are different other types of benefits of havinga smart home smart parking lots is very interesting smartparking lots is very interesting because you know so what happens is we all have experiencedthat when we are in the city and particularly when we are going in to the downtown areasor the central areas of a city typically parking is a huge problem so sometimes it might sohappen that in some places you do not have any parking spot at all and maybe there arefew other parking spots parking lots in the city which are vacant or relatively vacantand how do i get this information until i physically go there and get this informationget this information but you know that is basically infeasible however if we have asmart parking solution in a city then one can one can from the mobile device insidethe car one can get access to this information about which parking lots are available whichones are not and dynamically that information can be updated and made available to the usersand other things like autorotation of vehicles to empty slots empty parking lotsauto charging for the services that are provided detection of vacant lots in the parking lotand so on smart vehicles with respect to assistance even to drivers during bad whether if thereis a bad whether condition the low visibility condition the vehicles would be assisted aboutthe you know how to drive ahead you know what are different ways the roots that can be takenfrom a particular point to the destination and so on detection of bad driving by patternsor driving under the influence of substances you know so the vehicle should be alertingthe user of the vehicle driver and not only the driver may be the other correspondingstake holders like police or you know the respective dignitary bodies the authoritiesand so on auto alert generation duration crashes if there is accident auto alerts will be generatedwill be sent to the police the emergency personal and so onself diagnostics of the vehicle ah you know if there is something some component goingdown something is going wrong with the engine or ah you know any of the other componentsof ah of the vehicle you know so automatically it will diagnose and that information wouldbe made available to the user of the vehicle similarly smart health low cost portable athome medical diagnostic kits be made available remote checkups and diagnosis would be madepossible on body sensors for effortless and accurate health monitoring would be made availablefor use by the patients who need this kind of careauto alert generation in case of emergency medical episodes like heart attacks seizersetcetera automatically the emergency persons in the hospital will be made available andthat again is on the basis of subscription there might be several different several differenthospitals with which the patient might get connected but only to the hospitals with whichthe patient has a subscription you know so they will be get getting notified and theemergency vehicles are going to the ambulances going to come to the home of the patient automaticallywithout even having them to be informed pollution and calamity monitoring monitoringfor whether or manmade based calamities alert generation in case of above threshold pollutantsin air or water so on you know so now a days actually we have all these air monitoringsystems water monitoring systems these are in different isolation isolations basicallythis is ah monitor continuously we have the air quality index being monitored indifferentcities of our country so similar kind of thing is is going on in different other countriesas well so this sort of information from any point if i want to let us say from kharagpuri want to go to another place let us say delhi so before i travel you know i can check thatwhat is the air quality of that particular city that means delhi and then i can makea decision about whether i should go there or not may be even better would be if i canget an advisory about whether it is safe to travel to delhi because of this air contaminationthe air pollution and so on so this is just an example like this actuallythese can be similar kind of thing can be done with respect to pollution and ah youknow environment monitoring ah in a in any city smart energy like smart metering systemsyou know smart meters programmable meters through which you can do different thingsat your homes you know have differential usage being monitored and build accordingly in asmart grid smart energy kind of environment smart energy are allocation and distributionsystem incorporation of traditional and renewable sources of energy in the same gridso these are the different components these are the different benefits of smart energysmart agriculture likewise automatic detection of plant water stress monitoring of crop crophealth status auto detection of crop infection auto detection auto application of fertilizersand pesticides scheduling harvesting and arranging proper transfer of harvests to warehousesor markets so some of these actually as you will see in the case studies when we talkabout case study on agriculture you will see that we are already implementing these inour lab in the swan lab of the department of csc at iit kharagpur we are already implementingsome of these different things for smart agriculture we have ah projects by which the agriculturalfield are monitored with the help of censors and different other ict tools and that informationabout the field cognition is made available to farmers so that the farmers can decideaccordingly about what to do next so like this auto application of fertilizersis also possible and air born application of fertilizers with the help of spring orpesticides with the help of and autonomously automatically you know this sort of thingis made possible in a smart environment smart city so different technological focus areasinclude data collection with the help of mobile devices sensors and architecture i do notneed to elaborate on these same thing i also do not need to elaborate on the need for thetransmission of the data after collection of data through the above means with the helpof radios networking topologies and so on different types of topologies communicationand networking topologies ah consideration of those different topologies then the datathat is collected and transmitted have to be stored locally and then remotely and aswell in the form of data warehouses you know cloud storage and so on and they also againhave to be analyzed to first of all cleaned analyzed and predictedso there are different iot challenges in smart cities security and privacies one so becauseyou know all these different infrastructure are made available to all different typesof citizens so you know you expose yourself to different types of attacks the governmentofficers there are different files etcetera you know you make yourself vulnerable to differenttypes of attacks privacy leaks and so on when you open up more and more so that also hasto be taken up concurrently while building smart cities and the same thing exposure tovulnerabilities multi tenancy ah of ah you know so the same devices are basically youknow ah ah ah accessed by different tenants by different users and that multi tenancybasically induces the risk of data leakage the risk of data privacy leakage securitydata security and so on heterogeneity integration of varying hardwareplatforms and specifications is a very ah you know important challenge and when we talkedabout iot interoperability we spoke about some of these issues integration of differentradio specifications integration of various software platforms and accommodation of varyinguser requirements are some of the different other heterogeneity and interoperability issuesin iot and we already spoke about this thing in detail in the lecture on interoperabilityof iot in this in this particular course reliability unreliable communication due tovehicle mobility is not good similarly device failures can happen and that has to be takencare of large scale deployment ah also has different challenges ah so there would bedelay due to large scale deployment itself delay due to mobility of deployed notes andthe distribution of devices can also affect the monitoring tasks there are legal and socialissues as well ah for example services that are based on users user provided informationmay be subject to local or other national and international laws and that also has tobe taken care of in a very smart way individual and informed consent is required for usinghumans as data sources big data issues are there you know huge volumes of data comingat high speeds and ah you know different types of vary various types of data media you knowtext data and so on so these have to be clean ah in a purifiedand that is a time consuming ah process and then data it also has to be analyzed ah ahyou know in real time to make sense out of it and the corresponding actuation has tohappen so big data issues are there big data in a real time environment is a very importantand difficult challenge sensor networks you know ah we already spoke about sensor networksin detail earlier the deployment of sensor networks in a smart city comes with differentdifferent challenges the choice of different sensors for sensing is also very crucial energyplanning is very much required different devices consuming different energy levels how youare going to schedule how you are going to do do the duty cycling these are all differentissues in sensor networks so with this we come to an end of ah ah thesmart cities ah ah you know smart cities and smart homes focusing on smart cities specificallyin this particular lecture we have seen that there are different good use cases by whichwe can understand that smart cities is very much required and nothing else other thaniot and iot constituent technologies can help in the building of smart cities and that iswhy there is so much of so much of up search on not only research but also deployment andinvestment on building smart cities throughout the world and ah there is ah lot of opportunitythat is ahead in the building of smart cities and we are going to go through some of thesedifferent opportunities we have already seen the different challenges ahead some of thesedifferent other opportunities we are going through going to go through in the next lecturethank you
