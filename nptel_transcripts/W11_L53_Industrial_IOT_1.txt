this lecture is on industrial internet of things which ah is popularly known as iiotso iiot has differences with the existing iot the popular iot internet of things soindustrial internet of things has a different scope and there are some specificities thatare there in iiot so we are going to understand in this particular lecture ah what iiot ishow it differs from the regular iot and how iiot solutions are useful ah to ah to reallife industrial problemsso it is in two parts this particular lecture is in two parts the first part ah we are goingto talk about some of the basics of iiot so we start with the quote ah by paul howarthand what he has said is that iot as a concept has crossed the chasm from slide ware to realitywith many industries implementing iot solutions so basically you know what it means is thatiot is no longer confined to theory and ah you know a hype based a notion it is no longerlike that you know so it is being used in reality ah in industries ah different iotsolutions are being implemented in the industry for solving different industrial problemsto make industrial processes manufacturing processes much more efficient then the wayit is at presentso let us try to understand iiot vis a vis ah iot as we have already understood throughthe previous previous lectures that the main aim of iot is to interconnect different thingsand these things are different objects on the smart objects so what is required is toglobally connect these smart object or the things so that the objects are uniquely identifiedand they are able to interoperate between themselves so it is you know in an iot inan iot solution we what we have are different objects which are smart objects where thereis intelligence that are embedded in the different things so there are embedded systems thatare attached to the different things the worldly things and these things they ah which havetheir abstraction as smart objects they are able to interconnect with each other theyare able to internetwork with each other and so onso in the contrast in industrial internet of things we are focusing on industries particularlyparticularly focusing on industrial systems industrial automation enterprise systems enterpriseplanning product life cycle and so on and while we do it we basically digress from thecore requirements of iot and there are some specific requirements which concern industrialprocesses that come into picture so we are going to understand what these are in thisparticular lectureso before that in terms of the scope of iiot so basically it borrows some of the featuresof the existing internet of things iot plus it borrows some features from the vision ofindustry four point zero so industry four point zero basically gives a frame work forautomation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies so its a vision its a way forwardthat has been proposed so industry four point zero basically tries to improve the automationand data exchange in manufacturing technologies it tries to incorporate concepts from cyberphysical systems iot cloud computing and so on so what we have essentially is what iswell known as the smart factoryso iiot basically takes some features from the regular iot the conventional iot somefrom industry four point zero and try tries to have a separate vision separate technologyfor itself so what we have we have already understoodthat whereas iiot combines features from iot and industry four point zero it is not iotas such we have to understand this thing there are certain features that have been borrowedfrom iot but it is not the iot iiot and iot are not the one and the same they are notwhere as iot focuses on consumer level services consumer level products and so on iiot basicallyhas the focus on the enterprise so the scope for iot is consumer level where as the scopefor iot is enterprise levelso things such as concepts technologies methodologies such as machine learning big data technologym two m machine to machine communication automation these are some of the integral componentsfor building iiot so machine learning i think we all understand machine learning is veryvery popular its a its an its a part of artificial intelligence its a kind of artificial intelligenceso which basically now learns you know so learning form the past and there are differentthings you know so there are different aspects of machine learningso learning from the data the existing data and trying to make things predictive and tryingto have things which are better in the future so machine learning techniques and technologiesare used big data we are going to talk about ah big data ah later on ah ah so in anotherlecture ah we are going to talk about ah big data how to handle big data ah what are thetools that are available so will talk about that when we talk about data handling anddata analytics then machine to machine interaction machineto machine communication is about two machines directly talking to each other directly communicatingwith each other getting a particular work or a task accomplished without any human interventionwithout any human intervention so for example a robotic arm opening the door of a of a refrigeratorand then performing certain other tasks in the refrigerator thats an example of machineto machine so may be the robotic arm goes and opens the door of the refrigerator checkswhether there is sufficient milk in the milk pot of the refrigerator or not if there isno ah if if if if there is no sufficient milk then the system as a whole will send or themilk pot or the refrigerator will send an sms to the milk personso what is happening in the entire processes there is no human intervention so we havecommunicating with machine another machine communicating with another machine and soon we have machine to machine communication m to m without any human intervention so goingback we have machine to machine communication and automation so these are the differentdifferent features different aspects of iiot so iiot is supported by huge amount of datacollected from sensors it is based on wrap and reuse approach rather than rip and replaceapproach so what is meant by these terms is when we talk about iiot we are not talkingabout building a new system from scratch we are talking about using the existing manufacturingsystems existing industrial systems you know rap them with sensors actuators and so onand make things efficient we are trying to reengineer the existing systems and the processesand we are not building anything brand new from scratch so this is what we have to rememberwhen we discuss iiot so let us try to understand the evolutionof iiot so the first industrial evaluation happened with mechanized production then camemass production which is the second industrial revolution in the third industrial revolutioninternet and automation was featured in manufacturing and at present what we have is the fourthindustrial revolution which incorporates iiot so iiot is featured as part of the fourthindustrial revolution so if we look at this particular figure what we have starting fromseventeen hundreds when there was power generation and mechanical automation then came the eighteenhundreds industrialization in nineteen hundreds we had this electronic automation and at presentwe have smart automation and this is what this is how the industry four point zero evolvedtoday so in industry four point zero we have smart factories and so on in the industrialsector so when we talk about iiot it is about fourthgeneration of industrial automation that means industry four four point zero clubbed withthe second generation of internet evolution so internet at present so the the first generationof internet is the internet that we all use the regular internet with connects differentcomputers throughout the world this is the first generation of the internet second generationof the internet is about connecting different things connecting different machines and soon so iiot basically combines the second generationof internet fourth generation of industrial automation and cloud computing so cloud hasbecome very popular technology since about more than half a decade or so cloud has becomevery popular it is being used in the industrial sector as well so what happens is cloud basicallyoffers computational environments computational infrastructure computational platforms computationalsoftware in addition to regular storage so cloud is like a huge data storage which canstore lot of data and all these things huge data storage coupled with ah you know infrastructuresoftware platform hardware and so on and so forth everything one can get access to inan industry without basically having to purchase these of their own rightso cloud computing is very popularly used not only in others spheres of everyday lifebut also in the industry so in the iiot network we have physical objectsthat are interconnected we have different systems subsystems that are interconnectedthere are different platforms types of platforms that work together different applicationsand so on so these networks are iiot networks can communicate with one another the externalenvironment they communicate with the external environment and different people so peopleare also part of these iiot networks so there are different peoples the different end usersstake holders everybody at the enterprise enterprise level you know everything thatis there they all form part of iiot they have to be internetworked of course they have tobe connected these things the things people processes everything together connectedthe acquisition of iiot has led to availability and affordability of sensors processors andother technologies which facilitate capture and access to real time information so allthese iiot devices and where ever they are deployed through sensors sensors have becomeaffordable they are readily available nowadays the different processes other computers othercomputing devices technologies and so on they capture lot of data and they offer the datain real time for further analysis making making things much more efficient from the data thatis collected moving ahead iiot for building iiot thereare four broad requirements we need the hardware and software connectivity we need a cloudplatform and i already told you briefly about the necessity of cloud in the industrial sectorand how cloud can help with respect to processing infrastructure data storage and so on andso forth application development and big data analytics big data analytics is very importantall these different sensors in the industrial the industrial sensors the actuators thatare fitted to these different machines manufacturing equipment and so on they throw in lot of datathey throw in lot of data and that data is very important is very crucial it can reveala lot of information and that by by mining that data one can predict different thingsah in a ah to to to make these industrial ah ah processes ah ah much more efficientdifferent other views of iiot requirements one is access access with respect to any timeanywhere anything connectivity and anything connectivity is very important its a thirddimension that has been added to any any any time anywhere which was the you know pervasivewhich was the vision of pervasive communication pervasive systems so excess can you know onecan have access anything can be accessed at anytime from anywhere in iiot end to end securityis important and that is not only important for iiot but for any iot based system in factfor any computer based system user experience is very crucial you know ultimatelyits all about offering services to the users different stake holders so user experiencehas to be taken into account as one of the fundamental requirements for building iiotso what the users exactly want how they are ah problems can be addressed how it can besolved the problems can be solved and how through the use of the system that is beingdeveloped the iiot system that is being developed the users can do things better and how theirexperience as a whole can be improved transition to smart machines so machines byadding sensors actuators etcetera you are making the machine smart we are making themachine smart asset management is very important though assest management you know though thesedifferent sensors actuators etcetera the assets can be managed ah ah the industrial assetscan be managed ah ah in a much more efficient way so how the assets can be managed thisis one of the requirements that have to be considered for building iiot systemsbig data and cloud are very important cloud offers storage computational efficiency andso and so forth without basically having one to procure and ah ah by procure and deploythese computational infrastructure at their own workplaces or industrial in in the industryand big data you already told you that all these sensor actuators and each and everything that we have talked about so far the enterprise level at the enterprise level thepeople process things systems and so on and so forth they are going to throw in a lotof data these data are going to be sent quite ah ah the data are going to be sent ah inreal time ah ah and ah they ah they are they have characteristics they are not only bigin volume they have ah they come in huge velocities and ah you know they there are different typesof data test data speech data multimedia other types of data like images video etcetera allof which coming at the same time it has to be handled and so onso this is what we are going to cover in ah one of the next lectures when ah we talk aboutah how to handle data data handling and how to analyze the data that is received so whatwe what is required is to have a virtualized version of a physical plant so through iiotsystems what we are trying to build is a virtualized plant corresponding to a physical industrialplant so these physical plant and the different machines in the plant are fitted with differentsensors which throw in lot of data the sensors readings and from these virtualized plantlot of different types of instructions can be sent to the physical plant and the embeddedsystems that are attached to these machines to these instructions can help to maneuverto perform different operations on these machines there are different design considerationsfor building iiot to use an iot device for industrial applications these design objectiveshave to be considered energy is paramount energy with respect to the time for whichthe iot device can operate with limited power supply so we have limited power supply andwe want to extend the lifetime of the iot device that is installed that is fitted withan industrial machine latency is very crucial it corresponds tothe time that is required to transmit the data latency has to be minimized because letus say that we are talking about sensors that are fitted to a welding machine sensors thatare fitted to a wedding machine so you see that if latency is not very minimum then whatis going to happen by the time the instruction reaches the machine or you know the data issent ah to the operator or from the operator to the machine what happens is the weldingmachine might have performed more welding even in a been a fraction of a second so youknow so more part will get welded which is not requiredso precision with respect to the time is very crucial and when you talk about that latencyof operations latency in the transmission of the data is very crucial latency has tobe minimized to the extent possible through put is quite understandable we need maximumdata to be transmitted across the iiot network scalability likewise is very under stablewe are talking about not just one or two machines but large number of machines in the iiot spheretopology how these different because you know ultimately what is going to happen is thissensors and this communication devices they have they are going to be internetworked sowhat we are going to have is a network topology and in in this particular network topologywe have different devices with different specifications and they have been manufactured individuallyby different vendors so interpretability is very important not only that interoperabilityis important but how these devices form the network is very crucial as well so the overallnetwork topology formed out of the devices and how these devices interoperate with oneone another is something that has to be taken as one of the important primary design considerationsin building iiot safety and security likewise i do not needto elaborate further but are very important issues that also have to be taken into consideringindustrial safety you know so we need to understand these thing properly when we are talking aboutautomation as a whole in the industry it should not happen you know so things have to veryreliable the systems have to be very reliable it should not happen that the sensor is givinga wrong reading because of which a crankshaft or ah in a some of fuel ah you know goes goesthrough causing accident to the people who are working in the plant right so industrialsafety is very important so iiot system automation ah you know systems which offer automationetcetera they have to be very much reliable and they have to take in to account ah thedegree of safety ah ah and the security of the applicationso going back trying to understand iiot vis a vis iot so whereas iot traditionally focusseson the convenience of the individuals iiot focusses on the efficiency safety and securityof operation in terms of the machine to machine communication and machine to machine communicationi already spoke about earlier in terms of machine to machine communication iot definitelyuses machine to machine communication but it is not very exclusive you know the useof iot ah machine to machine communication in iot is limited whereas iiot extensivelyuses machine to machine communication m to m communication is extensively used in iiotthe whole industrial operation in a plant is automated so one machine talking to anothermachine second machine talking to third third to fourth and so on this is quite extensiveit is quite present in the industrial sector iiot so iiot heavily depends on machine tomachine communication so whereas iot traditionally focuses on applicationsat the consumer level iiot basically focuses on applications at the industrial level atthe enterprise level let us look at one more aspect so here m to m when we talk about mto m so m to m and iot m to m focusses on device to device communication there is aemphasis on communication between devices between machines and iot on the other handfocuses on the overall system integration of the system components sub components subsystems integration is a one of the important features of i iot so this is what we needto understand so m to m versus iot m to m focus on devices of course both of both mto m and iot they have focus on other aspects like network connectivity service enablementapplication and data these are there for both m to m and iot whereas m to m focuses on particularlyon devices iot basically focuses more on the system level integrationnow service management in iiot is very important its all about why do you want iiot we wantto offer ah improved services so service management is very crucial so service management basicallywhat it is referring to is the implementation and management of the quality of service whichmeets the end user demand end users demands are met and increasing the overall qualityof service so service is basically a collection of dataand the associated behaviors to accomplish a particular function or feature of a deviceor portions of a device so through iiot solutions the overall services the management of thedifferent services have to be improved so i will talk about very briefly over here servicescan be of two types one is the primary service the other one is the secondary service primaryservices are basics services which are responsible for the primary node functions whereas thesecondary services are auxiliary services auxiliary functions which provides servicesto the primary service or secondary services are termed as secondary service rightso what we have primary service are basic they are very important you know you needthose services whereas secondary services are auxiliary services which may or may notbe there so with this we come to an end of ah the first part of iiot we have understoodthe basics of iiot how iiot differs from iot what is the difference between iot and m tom so this what we have looked at in ah in in in this part of the lecture on industrialinternet of things thank you
