the next protocol that we are going to go through is also for offering connectivitybetween different devices forming the connectivity and this protocol is the six lowpan protocolso this six lowpan protocol is basically it runs over ipv six that is from where thissix figure comes so it is from ipv six so it runs over ipv six so it offers radio connectivityradio linkages over ipv six protocol so using ipv six protocoland ipv six as we know is for addressing its an addressing protocol and it is very popularfor use ah for addressing in the case of iot networks because of the large address spacethat is required for iot so let us look at this six lowpan protocol so its stands forsixlowpan stands for low power wireless personal area network over ipv six and it allows forthe smallest devices and each of these devices having limited processing ability to transmitinformation wirelessly over the internet protocolso we have low power small devices limited processing capability as is typical of iotsystems and wireless communication being present so so it basically helps in ah establishingconnectivity in this kind of networks so it basically helps this six lowpan protocol ithelps and allows to have this low power devices to connect over the internet because ipv sixis going to be used for addressingso ah at the network layer so that is the reason five ah this protocol is useful forconnecting this iot network this low power devices to the internet it is basically createdout of the ietfrfc five nine three three and rfc four nine one one so these are the twodifferent ah rfcs based on which this six lowpan protocol is specified so this specificationis available in these rfcsso these are some of these features of six lowpan it allows i triple e eight zero twopoint fifteen point four radios that means the in the previous lecture we have gone throughah this particular protocol which is useful for setting up ah connectivity ah betweenthe different nodes and it primarily operates at the physical and the mac layers so theradios of the eight zero two point fifteen point four is used to carry one twenty eightbit addresses of the ipv sixso basically six lowpan is an ah an application or its a its joining ah you know conceptualjoining of ah eight zero two point fifteen point four radios with ipv six but how itis made possible because you know eight zero two point fifteen point four it is low powersin light weight protocol and ipv six is not lightweight so how it is made possible sothe header it is possible with the help of header compression and address translationtechniques that basically helps to converts eight zero two point fifteen point four radiosto access the internetso it will help this eight zero two point fifteen point four redios to access the internetusing header compression and address translation techniques ipv six packets are compressedand reformatted to fit the eight zero two point fifteen point four packet structureso this is what is done ipv six packets large in size they have to be compressed they haveto be reformatted and they have to be mapped with the packet format of eight zero two pointfifteen point four which is primarily meant for low power networks small scale low powernetworks as is typical of iotso it can be used for iot six lowpan can be used for iot smart grid applications smarthome applications m to m applications and many other different similar applicationsso for addressing in six lowpan there are two types of addresses that are used sixteenbit short address which is for pan specific communication that means it is assigned bythe pan coordinator for communicating within the pan the personal area network and thesixty four bit extended address which is used for global unique connectivity global uniqueaddressing throughout the networkso ipv six multicast is not supported by eight zero two point fifteen point four and ipvsix packets are carried as link layer broadcast frames in the case of six lowpan so we havein front of us the packet format of six lowpan so as we can see over here if you look veryclosely we have eight zero two point fifteen point four and ipv six club together eightzero two point fifteen point four radio and ipv six for addressing over the internet andthis corresponding fields are also shown over hereso what we have for corresponding to ipv six we have the source address the destinationaddress and these different other ipv six fills that are typical in ah in this particularah protocol ipv six protocol and for eight zero two point fifteen point four as wellthere is this source ah the destination ah both of which are sixty four bits that meanssource and destination together will become one twenty eight bitsthen we have this pan id ah ah because you know when we are talking about fifteen pointfour networking mode go to personal area network so the pan id is basically store in this particularfield and so so this is how the six lowpan packet format looks likeso that is the packet format now what about the header there are three different typesof headers one is known as the dispatch header the second one is known as the ah the meshaddressing header and the third one is known as the fragmentation headerso let us look at these three different headers the format of these headers are given overhere so how many bits we have we have eight sixteen twenty four thirty two so the headeris thirty two bits long so out of which the first two bits are used to identify the dispatchtype and this dispatch type basically helps in the dispatch communication initiating thecommunication resetting the communicationnow this dispatch field has six bits so it is six bits long field and this basicallyidentifies the next header type and there after the next list of the bits are used tospecify the type specific header and that is determined by the dispatch header so thenwe have the mesh addressing header and here basically the first two bits are used to storethe id of the mesh addressing headerthe next field the v field is zero if the originator is a sixty four bit extended addressand it is one if it is the sixteen bit address and we have seen that both of these are possibleto have sixteen bit as well as sixty four bit address the f field is zero if the destinationis sixty four bit address and one if it is sixteen bit address and the hops left aredecremented by each node before sending to the next hopso how many hops are left until the final destination node this is basically storedin this particular field and is decremented as i said hop by hop when one hop is overit is complete that field the value is decremented by one and third in a type is a fragmentationheader and the corresponding fields are shown over here so in this case the first fragmenthas this structure the header has this structure as shown over here and the subsequent fragmentshave this particular structureso as you can see over here the main difference between the first fragment and the subsequentfragments is the inclusion of the datagram offset so this datagram offset basically showsthat it will give the value of what are the subsequent frames that are there so this willbasically help ah ah ah ah ah to connect with the first frames sosix lowpan because it involves a strong network layer component it takes care of routingso the most important type of routing is a mesh based routing and this mesh based routingis used in the context of a pan topology personal area network topology so routing is used routingbasically is based on the ipv six protocol in the personal area network domain and thereare two protocols that are used in six lowpan for routingone is the load ng protocol the other one is the rpl protocol and as you can see overhere from this particular figure we have this ipv six domain and we have this personal areanetwork a pan and with the help of this coordinator of the gateway it connects to the ipv sixnetwork that means the ipv six based internet the load ng routing protocol it is primarilya derivation from the aodv protocol that is available and was proposed for ad hoc networksand this has been used and extended for iot networksso this load ng protocol has few different pdos the first one is the load request pdosand it is generated by a load ng router the originator for discovering a route to thedestination so the forwarding of such route requests take place until they reach the destinationload ng router then comes the route replies which is generated upon receipt of the routerequest by the indicated destination and unicast hop by hop forwarding of these route repliestowards the originatorthere is also this route error message that is used to return errors to the originatorof the data in the event that there is some route breakage that take place so optimizedrouting is supported reducing the overhead that is in cut by the route request generationand flooding only the generation is permitted sorry only the destination is permitted torespond to the route request intermediate routers of load ng are explicitly prohibitedfrom responding to the route request even if they have been very active in terms ofseeking routes and generating routes in the networkthe route requestand route reply messages are generated by a given load ng router andthis share a single unique monotonically increasing sequence number next comes the rpl routingprotocol which is based on the distance vector routing for lossy and low power networks sothis is where this l comes from this lossy and ah so it is used for lossy networks aswell as low power networks for routingso it maintains routing topology using low rate beaconing beaconing rate over here increaseson detecting inconsistencies with respect to situation such as load failure or linkfailure routing information is included in the datagram itself it uses two types of routingproactive routing for maintaining routing topology and reactive for dissolving routinginconsistencies the rpl basically separates the packet processing and forwarding fromthe routing optimization objective which helps in low power lossy networks the llnsso this particular protocol it supports features such as confidentiality integrity ensuringintegrity validating data paths and detecting the presence of loops the overall optimizationobjectives of routing includes minimizing the energy minimizing the latency and satisfyingthe constants with respect to node power bandwidth etcetera this rpl protocol operates usingbidirectional links so there is bidirectional flow of communication of messagesso in some lln scenarios that means the lossy scenarios these links may exhibit asymmetricproperties right so basically asymmetric property means that while the message is sent fromthe source to that is the recipient it flows through one route may be directly but becauseof all these environmental situations or whatever the response or the flow of message in theother direction doesnt take place through the same route maybe it comes back throughanother route so it is asymmetric so it is required that the reachability of a routeris verified before the router can be used as a parentfinally for this particular lecture we are going to go through the protocol rfid rfidis very popular it is commonly used it is still use it has been in use for long it isstill used shopping malls ah then what places you know for example the id cards ah are fittedwith rfid tags rfid ah tags can be scanned in the rfid ah readers similar things happenin the shopping malls like when we go for purchase in certain items for example clothingsense one these also are fitted with these rfid tags and these rfid id tags can be ahcan can be used to scan against rfid readers to get further information and so onso how does rfid work an rfid is we have to remember that sensor networks and rfid sensornetworks we have not yet covered will cover in a subsequent lecture but rfids and sensornetworks and also other technologies such as zigbee eight zero two point fifteen pointfour for w pans nfc also which is very similar to rfid these are different other connectivityoffering ah ah mechanisms that are popularly used for iot applications so these are thecore for establishing connectivity in iot networksso going back to rfid we have so first of all rfid the its an acronym its an acronymfor radio frequency identification so where the data is digitally encoded in these rfidtags and these data can be read from the rfid tags so rfid tags are encoding the data andthese data can be scanned from the rfid tags by the rfid reader so these very similar tothe bar coding schemes and qr coding schemesso in a barcode what happens in a barcode like in libraries cetera in a bar bar codingschemes are typically used to store information about the books and you know having the identifiersfor the books so the barcode basically i like vertical lines right so so there is a barcodereader which can read those vertical lines the barcodes similarly there is the qr codewhich is sort of like a that square square kind of thing which is used for scanning thedata right so these are the qr codesso there is that reader which can take that image and it can it can basically processthat image to identify the data that is embedded in that particular code so rfid tags are alsovery similar in operation to the barcodes and qr codes but the functionality or theway these operate are vastly different so let us now try to understand how rfid tagsthe rfid principle worksso every rfid tag consists of an integrated circuit and an antenna so basically its avery small the small tag so tag inside the tag there is some circuitry that is thereand a small and a antenna which is embedded into it inside it so this antenna is goingto use it is going to be used for communication with the outside world that means outsidethe tag and the circuitry basically does number of things including storing the informationin that particular tag may be the rfid tag could be for a smart card that can be usedfor storing employee informationso you know employees have employees in an organization have ah different identificationah ah ah for different identifiers and those identifiers the different data can be storedin electronic form inside the chip that is built into this rfid tags so the rfid tagconsist of integrated circuit and an antenna the tag is covered by a protective materialso outside the tag is some kind of a shielda protective material which can also act asa shield against various environmental effectsthe tags can be of two types one is the passive tag the other one is the active tag so passivetags are more common and the way these passive tags are operated are through the processof inductivity so inductively when these passive tags when these tags come in proximityto the rfid reader there is some inductive effect some magnetic force fields are createddue to which the information is transferred from the tag to the reader or from the andand vice versa so from the tag to the reader and vice versaso on the other hand so those are the passive tags on the other hand the active tags theyhave their own little source of power supply the working principle of rfid is similar toits predecessor which is called the aidc the aidc full form is automatic identificationand data capture technology so it performs object identification object data collectionand mapping of the collected data to computer systems with little or no human interventionso the concept of rfid is basically adopted from aidc which is its predecessor so aidcis no longer very common however the difference is rfid is mostly wireless not mostly it isfully wireless on the other hand aidc uses wired communication so rfid basically usesradio waves that means wireless communication to perform different functions which are alsoperformed by aidcso let us try to understand how rfid works let us say that there is a tagged item letus say that there is a tagged item like a clothing or something in a shopping mall somekind of a cloth so this cloth is tagged with this rfid reader not sorry rfid tag it istagged with this rfid tag it is attached to the rfid tag this rfid tag consists of thecircuitry some kind of a quailing mechanism and the coverthis cover is some kind of a polymer some plastic or some other polymer and the circuitryis basically stored inside this particular tag then we have this one if we look overhere so we have this part we have this part which basically is for the reader so thispart is for the rfid tag and this part is for the rfid reader the as we can see overhere this rfid reader has a software and a source of power supply and it also has a coiland when you bring that reader which has has a coil inside some magnetic coil then thereis this magnetic inductive effect producing this magnetic lines of force are createdso this is how the data that is there in that small chip inside the rfid tag is transferredto the rfid reader with the help of this force field magnetic force field rfid tags and rfidsin general are useful for supporting different iot applications such as inventory managementasset tracking in an organization personal tracking you know who is coming when who isliving when in an organization what is the attendanceso attendance tracking systems for example controlling access to restricted areas soyou know whoever is authorized will be having an rfid tag and they can bring it in closeproximity to the rfid reader and if it is a valid tag then the person the door is goingto open for that person and the person can get in so it is used for controlling accessto the restricted areasid badging so basically you know identity identity badges smart cards in an organizationit is used for that supply chain management counterfeit prevention particularly in theah pharmaceutical industry so these are different applications of the rfid tags so with thiswe come to an end of this particular ah lecture and there are few other protocols that arealso very much useful ah and we are going to go through them in the next lecturesthank you
