so in this lecture on data analysis and sorry data handling and analytics in the first partwe will focused mostly on data handling and in the second part we are going to focus mostlyon the analytics so having captured the data and storing it in the cloud or in the serveror whatever whatever storage mechanisms we have we now have to use the data for usingit we have to analyze it we have to analyze the data so from this there are differenttools different methodologies that they are the most common the most primitive once arebased on statistical methods so basic statistical methods can be applyapplied on the store data in what order to make more sense out of that data in orderto get more insight into that data it is stored so we have data analytics so basically thedata has have to be analyzed so you know in the context of iot people talk a lot aboutdata analytics so what is the state analytics i am going to read one of these definitionsso data analytics is the process of examining the data sets in order to draw conclusionsabout the information they contain that means what information is contained in this datasets increasingly with the with the aid of specialized systems and software so with differentspecialized software systems etcetera to get insight into the data that is existingdata analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries toenable organizations to make more informed business decisions and by scientist and researchersto verify or disprove the scientific models theories and hypothesis so this is basicallythe premise in which data analytics ah basically work and the different concerns of data analyticsare basically i mentioned in this particular definition so when we talk about analysisin general broadly analysis comes in two forms so we can either perform qualitative analysison the data that has been obtained or we can perform quantitative analysisso qualitative analysis basically deals with the analysis of data that are categoricalin nature so qualitative analysis where as quantitative data quantitative analysis refersto the process by which numerical methods can be used numerical data can be analyzedthrough quantitative analysis so categorical data qualitative analysis is good enough fornumerical data quantitative analysis quantitative methods are used for so qualitative analysisdata is not described through numerical values but are described by some sort of descriptivecontexts such as text this qualitative data can be gathered by many methods such as frominterviews intervene different people from videos from audio recordings field notes youknow industry manuals and so on this data needs to be interpreted the groupingof the data can be where should be performed in to identifiable themes in quantitativequalitative analysis and the qualitative analysis can be summarized by three basic principlesnotice the things collect the things and think about the things we dont need to get intodetails of each of these the next one is the quantitative analysis so quantitative analysisis on the numeric data using different statistical methods such as descriptive statistics morespecifically finding out the mean of the dataset median standard deviation and so on the followingor often involved with the quantitative analysis statistical models analysis of variance thendata dispersion analysis of relationship between variables contingency and correlation thenregression analysis statistical significance precision error limits and so onso these are the different quantitative methods that are used for quantitative analysis ofdata now comes the comparison between qualitative data and quantitative data so qualitativedata can be mostly observed where is quantitative data can be measured qualitative data involvesdescriptions its more qualitative it involves descriptions on the other hand quantitativedata involves numbers ah numerics and so on whereas in qualitative data the emphasis ison quality in the quantitative data the emphasis is on quantity examples of qualitative datainclude colour smell taste etcetera which cannot be quantified so easily on the otherhand quantifiable data include volume weight etcetera these numbers these are figures whichcan be used to perform different numerics the advantages of data analytics is that itallows for the identification of important trends it helps the businesses identify performanceproblems that we require some sort of action some prediction can be performed by analysisof the data fast data something you know so the businesses they can understand that whathas gone wrong quantitatively we can be done or even qualitatively so data analytics areuseful for that so the analytics can also be performed in a visual manner and that canhelp in faster and better decision making analytics can provide a company with an edgeover their competitors so that is the reason actually data analyticshas become very popular in the industry not only in the industrial almost in all spheresof life data analytics has become very popular and because you can get more insight intowhat is going on in the processes that are occurring around you statistical differentmodels of statistical statistical models can be adopted in order to perform quantitativeanalysis and a statistical model can is defined as the mathematical equation that is formulatedto form the relationship between variables a statistical model illustrates how a setof random variables is related to another set of random variables and it is a statisticalmodel is represented as an ordered pair x p where x denotes the set of all possibleobservations and p refers to the set of probability of distributions on xstatistical models are broadly categorized as complete models and incomplete models completemodels have the same number of variables as the number of equations so the number of equationsand the number of variables in the complete models are the same so if we have the numberof variables equating equating with the number of equations what we have is a complete modeland in an incomplete model the number of variables and the number of equations are not the samethey do not match so in order to build a statistical model itis required to gather the data perform descriptive methods think about what are the predictorsthen build the model and then interpret the results analysis of variance in short knownas anova analysis is a parametric statistical technique that can be used to to compare twodata sets two or more data sets they can be compared so anova is best applied when morethan two populations of samples are meant to be compared so we have one dataset we haveanother dataset we want to compare these two populations to see that what is the you knowhow much is the correlation between these two datasets you know what what sort of similarityexits between these two database sets so to perform anova one has to have a continuousresponse variable an at least one categorical factor for example age gender etcetera withat least two or more levels example location one location two etcetera so what it meansis basically levels means that one location one location kharagpur another location kolkataso these are two different locations corresponding to two or four different levels and categoriesmeans the you know age is one category so with respect to a particular category likeage you know so at two different locations what is the similarity or what is the dissimilaritysimilarly with respect to gender or any other category anova requires data from approximatelynormally distributed population so this is a very important ah you know assumption ora very important requirement ah that you know so normal distribution is required for performingnormal distribution of the data set has to be there in order to perform anova analysisthe properties to perform anova one is the independence of case case the sample thatis selected should be random random is selected there should not be any bias there shouldnot be any pattern in the selected sample normality is the second property which constantthe distribution of each group should be normal so distribution normal distribution of thedata within the group and homogeneity which constants variance between the groups andthey should be the variance should be the same so we should not have a scenario to comparethe data from cities with the data from maybe slums slum areas or maybe the data of kharagpurcompared with the data of kolkata so because we have a town we have a city sotwo different datasets you know compare of comparing with each other so they have hugevariance and the variance should be as much minimal as possible analysis of variance hasthree different types one way analysis which constant one fixed factor for example thefactors could be age gender etcetera could be two way analysis where two or more or twofactors are going to be involved so both maybe both age and gender will be considered ina two way factor two way anova analysis and it can be k way analysis where k factor variablesare involved then there are different ways different featuresthat are there for performing analysis of variance total sum of square is one f ratiois another and the degree of freedom so all of these things have to be taken into considerationin order to perform and its a variance i am not going to put through these because thisis not essentially a course in statistical methods and these are all available and butwhat is important is that anova analysis can be used in order to perform analytics on thedata that is obtained from iot systems the next concept that has to be understoodis data dispersion data dispersion concerns how much is the dispersion that means so dispersionis basically a measure of the statistical so its a measure of statistical dispersiona non negative real number that is zero if all the data are the same and it increasesat the as the data becomes more diverse examples of dispersion measures include range averageabsolute deviation variance and standard deviation so typically you know we when we talk aboutdispersion we typically talked about in terms of variance and standard deviationso how much the deviate from the norm from the norm so this is what dispersion constantsso here you know as i already mentioned so range and what is meant by it the absoluteah ah standard deviation is given so the average of the absolute deviation is given varianceand standard deviation here well known methods and dispersion deciding and these are givenover here next comes a contingence and correlation so in statistics a contingency table is atype of table in a matrix format that displays the multivariate frequency distribution ofthe variables in it provides the basic picture of the interrelation between two variablescorrelation is a technique for investigating the relationship between two continuativecontinuous variables so they have to be continuous variable thisis very important and how much they are correlated these two variables how much they are correlatedand what is the relationship between them so a popular measure is the pearsons correlationcoefficient and ah it basically measures the strength of association between two variablesthen comes regression analysis so regression analysis basically tries to estimate the relationshipamong the different variables it focuses on the relationship between independent variableand one or more independent variables so we have a dependent variable and we have an independentah we have one or more independent variables and how the dependent variable relates toone or more of this variables taken at a time or taken togetherso regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable giventhe independent variables the estimation target is a function of the independent variablescalled the regression function it characterizes the variation of the independent variablearound the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution soregression analysis is helpful in different ways it can be used to understand how theindependent variables are related to the dependent variable one at a time or taken together statisticalsignificance is important it basically measures the likelihood that the difference in conversionrates between given variation and the baseline is not due to any random chanceso statistically how much the you know the results are significant is something thathas to be measured so statistical significance basically ah ah reflects the risk toleranceand the confidence level so how much is the confidence on the results that are obtainedso this is measure through statistical significance so typically there are two key variables thatare required for determining statistical significance one is the sample size the other one is thethe effect size the sample size refers to the sample size of the experiment the largerthe sample size is the more confident one can be on the result of the experiment andthe effect size is just the standardized mean difference between the two groups so if aparticular experiment is replicated the different effect size estimates from each study caneasily be combined to give an overall best estimate of the effect sizeprecision and error limits are important so precision basically concerns how close theestimates are from the different samples ah from the different samples to each other thestandard error is a measure of the precision when the standard error is small the estimatesfrom the different samples will be closed in value and vice versa so precision is inverselyrelated to the standard error so this precision an error become hand in hand the limits ofthe error and the overestimate and the underestimate are taken into consideration while consideringthe error limits so as i was mentioning at the outset thatthere are different statistical tools that additional statistical tools like correlationanalysis regression analysis analysis of variance can be used in order to understand to howto get insight on the data that is obtained that is collected but these are the basicah analytic methods and what we have not discussed over here and we have intentionally confinedourselves to not discussing things like how text can be how text can be analyzed textualdata or how video data can be analyzed and so on so that requires video data images canbe analyzed and so on so and different other types of data can be analyzedso this we have intentionally not discussed because that requires specialized trainingin text processing video processing image processing and so on and we do not want toget into the depth of those type of analytics so these are the differences and ah so withthis we come to an end and as i was telling ah mentioning before data handling data analyticsare very crucial in the context of iot because lot of data gets generated in the iot domainand this data not only have to be analyze but prior to analyzing they have to be handledthey have to be handled using technologies such as cloud we have to be handled with technologysuch as and so on and once they are handled that means the data have been stored theyhave been they have been cleaned and stored ah and so on then they have to be analyzedfor analysis we have these different statistical methods we have different other methods basedin machine learning image processing video processing text processing and so on so thoseare advance methods which we do not cover in this particular lecture in this particularcourse so thank you
