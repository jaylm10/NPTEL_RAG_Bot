we will now in this particular lecture cover two important protocols z wave and isa hundredpoint eleven a these are two very important protocols that in addition to zigbee heartwireless heart bluetooth r f i d nfc are also used for building iot systems however whereaszigbee is more popular for all sorts of all sorts of iot systems use in iot systems zwave is particularly attractive for building home automation systems and as you know bynow in this course that home automation is one of the important application areas ofiot home automation home automation includes what home home automation includes thingssuch as having some kind of a robot or having mobile phones that will do number of differentthings different day to day functions at homes H can be done spontaneously and so on andso forthso how can it be done this is what home automation does so automating different functions inat home is something that is of primary concern of home automation so i was talking aboutz wave z wave is a technology which comes from the z wave alliance so this z wave alliancein the same way as we have a zigbee alliance we also have a z wave alliance and this zwave alliance is particularly pushing for making this technology very attractive tosupport different home automation appliance applications different home automation functionsand we are going to look at how using z wave we could be able to improve the automationof different functions using different iot devices at home so we look at this z wavez wave is also written in different ways we could be writing z wave altogether or usinga space in between z and wave or using a hyphen in between z and wave and this is a protocolthat is used for communication between different iot devices for home automation as i justsaid before it uses rfs for signaling and control and the operating frequency for itis different from the ones that we have seen we have seen that primarily the the otherthings like heart or you know nfc etcetera etcetera they all operate in the two pointfour gigahertz band and for z wave the operating frequency isnine zero eight point four two megahertz in us eight sixty eight point four two megahertzin europe and for different other countries i will show you in a short while that fordifferent other countries there are different other frequencies of operation so in z wavethere is some kind of a mesh network topology that is formed and maintained between differentnodes which can be up to about two thirty two in number in a single network now letus look at some interesting points in z wave so we have let us say we have we are talkingabout home automation in a particular home there could be different rooms let us saythis is room one room two room three and room four in z wave if we are using z wave thereis something called the z wave controller and there are different z wave devices thatare there so typically in a single home there is only one z wave controller and there couldbe different so these are all z wave devices one z wave controller and one or more thatmeans several z wave devices these z wave devices they could be either connecting directlyor they could be connecting with the help of a relay node in between so this is onez wave device this is another z wave z wave device and this could be a third z wave deviceand this could be something like an ad hoc mode of communication ok so this is how zwave basically functions so i was telling you that ah in us nine zeroeight point four and nine sixteen frequency bands in ah europe eight sixty eight pointfour two and eight sixty nine point eight five megahertz frequency band and for othercountries these different frequencies of operation are shown over here in this particular tableso as we can see that for india it is eight sixty five point two megahertz operating frequencya very interesting and important concept is z wave doesnt use fsk modulation directlywhat it does is it passes through a gaussian filter so essentially what happens is it becomesgaussian fsk modulation and the channel encoding scheme that is used is manchester encodingthis is one concept the second thing is as i was mentioning earlier there is an entitya single entity called the network controller the central network controller that sets upand manages a z wave network each logical z wave network has one home id and multiplenode ids for the devices in it and that home id basically corresponds to a single networkid so so essentially because there is only homeid which is unique to a particular home the other networks in other homes will not beable to communicate through between these different homes i hope that my point is clearso what i am saying is that every home has its unique home id or network id and in thatparticular home only that other ah z wave devices will be able to communicate so theywill not be able to communicate with other homes the z wave devices in a particular homewill not be able to communicate with other homesso we are restricting this communication of z wave devices to specific homes so nodeswith different home ids cannot communicate with each other and we also have to keep inmind that the node id length in z wave there is one byte and the network id length is fourbytes so i was talking to you i was mentioning about these gfsk modulation which is gaussianfrequency shift keying so what happens is there is a gaussian filter prior to fsk youpass it pass the signal through a gaussian filter to smoothen to smoothen the pulsesso that you have will formed pulses which will occupy limited spectrum width and thisprocess is known as pulse shaping so in here in this figure as we can see thisis a typical figure of a home in this home we have different rooms we have bedrooms wehave a living living room we have a kitchen we have bedrooms and so on and as we can seethat if we have to implement z wave we need a z wave controller and these different redcolored and green colored nodes which are the z wave n devices the z wave nodes so thecontroller basically sets of connectivity between each of these different nodes as wecan see in this particular example the controller has one hop communication with these greencolored nodes however the controller to these red color nodes are multi hop ok they arenot within the one hop communication range so if this controller has to communicate withah ah this red colored node in this particular room then it has to do via this green colornode z wave uses mesh topology and it also uses source routing so source routing meansthat even before the packet is sent the entire route is basically encoded or embedded beforethe packet is sent forward so before the the ah packet is sent the entire route informationis embedded to it so the entires route is known to the source and is given to the packetso the packet will know how it will traverse through the entire network or until it reachesthe intended destination so the devices they communicate with one anotherwhen they are in range when the devices are not in range as i was showing you using thosered colored z wave nodes in the previous figure the messages in such a case are routed throughdifferent nodes to bypass the obstructions that are created by household appliances orlayout and this is very important because you know so there are so many physical obstructionsin the in the home right there are walls between different rooms etcetera etcetera so whathappens is there will be these different nodes which will be acting as sort of gateways orrelay nodes to facilitate communication between these remote z wave nodes that are not withinthe direct transmission range with the controller and now we have remove the sketch of the roomsand this is what is shown over here we have the green color nodes and this one which arewithin the direct communication range the direct path and then there are these nodeswhich are within not within the direct communication range and there they can communicate withthe help of the healing path so this is known as the healing path and this is known as thedirect path z wave and zigbee how do they compare so z wave is user friendly it providessimple system that users can set themselves on the other hand zigbee requires so littlepower the devices can last up to seven years on a single set of batteries z wave is idealfor someone with a basic understanding of technology who wants to keep their home automationsecure efficient simple and easy to maintain on the other hand usingzigbee zigbee is ideal for technology experts who want a system that can customize withtheir preferences and install themselves so lot of sophistication can be done with thehelp of zigbee on the other hand z wave is more user friendly more customer friendlybut a limited set of things can be done with the help of z wave compare to zigbee z waveis expensive compare to zigbee and nine out of ten leading security and communicationcompanies in us use z wave for smart home solutions on the other hand for zigbee thereis zigbee alliance that consists of more than hundred member organizations that use developand improve the open standard that is offered by zigbeenow we come to the second very important protocol which is the is a hundred point eleven a soits protocol that has been ah designed by the international society of automation andthis is particularly used for plants in the industries industrial complexes industrialplants and so on and so forth there are more than one billion devices that use isa hundredpoint eleven a at present it is designed to support native and tunneled application layersvarious transport services including reliable based effort real time services are offeredwith the help of isa hundred point eleven point eleven a so isa hundred point elevena is primarily attractive as a consequence in industrial sectors particularly for implementingindustrial iot systems the network and transport layers are based on tcp or udp or ipv sixand the data link layer supports mesh networking with frequency hoppingso frequency hopping spread spectrum is typically used in isa hundred point eleven a the differenttopologies that are used for implementing this particular standard is the star or thetree topology or the mesh topology as well so all these topologies can be used for implementingit and the radio that is used um beneath underneath is based on eight zero two point fifteen pointfour again the permitted networks in include radio link isa over ethernet and fill busesfill bus means that its a bunch of wires and bunch of wires you know running between differentdevices as we see in the data centers or server rooms and so onwe have these buses and filled buses means between different filled buses we have thishigh bandwidth high ah capacity links that run between them the application layer supportsah delivery of communication services to the users and the management processes the ahah this particular ah ah thing can pass objects methods or attributes natively within theah isa hundred point eleven a protocol a tunneling mode is available to allow legacy data throughthis particular network so what we have is a sce scenario like this we have these backbonedevices the black colored rectangles here we have the back ah backbone devices we haveah this non routing devices the red colored once the blue colored once are the routingdevices and these green colored once are the handle devices and then we have the securitymanager the gateway and the system manager which basically function from beyond the backboneso this is the typical architecture of ah ah of this particular ah use of isa hundredpoint eleven a protocol in industries or smart factories the features of this particularprotocol include flexibility support for multiple protocols use of open standards support formultiple applications reliability including error detection channel hopping determinismusing tdma qos support is also also implemented ah in the case of ah ah u use of this particularpro protocol qos support is very important qos guarantee is more specifically becausethis is what basically ensures the determinism tdma we understand time slots predefined peopleknow what is going to happen next qos support ah also is very important qos guarantees areimportant because you know we need to know that at leastthis is what is going to happen in the future by running this particular network using thisstandard and security is also a very important feature of this particular protocol so securityis fully been built into this particular standard the isa hundred point eleven a standard authenticationand confidential services are independently available a secu network security managermanages and distributes the keys so key management including key distribution key revocationetcetera etcetera these are all taken care of by the network security manager so twindata security steps in each node include data link layer encrypting each hop transport layersecuring peer to peer communication so these are the different usage classes correspondingto different categories of applications for safety the classes are zero and one zero standsfor application such as emergency taking some eme emergency applications emergency actionin some critical situation one is for closed loop regulatory control which may also becritical then we have category control category which has classes one two and three one standsfor closed loop regulatory control for closed loop supervisory control and three for openloop control and then we have the category monitoring where the class fo four basicallyah stands for applications such as alerting ah and ah plus fivewhich is for logging and downloading and this particular class the logging downloading classdoesnt have any immediate operational consequence so with this we come to an end of this particularlecture and ah we have not only gone through the isa and ah isa hundred point ah elevena protocol ah but also the z wave protocol in this lecture and ah we have also gone throughpreviously in the connectivity technologies different protocols set a such as zigbee whichis based on eight zero two point fifteen point fourthen we have gone through ipv six we have gone through rfid we have gone through ahah we have gone through nfc we have gone through z wave we have gone through heart wirelessheart and we have gone through all different types of technologies that can be used foroffering connectivity between different devices these different ah ah connectivity protocolsthey all have their own distinctive features which make them very attractive for use indiverse applications of iot implementation ah so we come to an end not only of this lecturebut also the series of lectures on connectivity technologies thank you
