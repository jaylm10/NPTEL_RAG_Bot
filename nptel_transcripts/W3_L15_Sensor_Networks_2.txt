in the previous lecture we have already gone through some of the basic concepts of sensornetworks we have seen that by interconnecting the different nodes in the network we canhave an extended coverage of sensing and that way we can also have emote real time distancemonitoring of what is occurring around this physically deployed nodes in the network wehave also seen that there are different types of sensor networks stationary sensor networksmobile sensor networks and mobile sensor networks again can be of different types one is aerialmobile sensor networks that means the mobile networks which move you know sensor networksthat move in the space we have terrestrial sensor networks so where the nodes they moveon the surface of the earth and we can have underwater sensor networks where the nodesbasically move in the underwater area so whatever be the sensor network whetherit is underwater terrestrial or aerial these nodes they basically have to cooperate withone another in order for the network to function if the nodes do not cooperate they will notbe able to function so how how to promote cooperation so before that we need to understandthe behavior of the different nodes in the networkso when we talk about sensor networks we have we have nodes that would be behaving as theyare supposed to behave we can have nodes that would be misbehaving so we can have normalnodes we can have misbehaving nodes so normal nodes we do not need to worry aboutthey you know as per the requirement the function the way they are supposed to function misbehavingnodes this misbehavior can be of two types one is that they misbehave unintentionallyand the other one is where they misbehave intentionally you know intentionally theymisbehave and unintentionally means they dont dont want to misbehave as such but you knowunintentionally they end up on end up misbehaving so in the intentional category we have twotypes one is the malicious node and the other one is the selfish node and in the unintentionalcategory we have the failed nodes and the badly failed nodes so these basically formsthe taxonomy of behavior of nodes in a sensor network ok so going ahead we have normal nodesthat work perfectly in an ideal environment condition failed nodes which are unable toperform the functions that they are supposed to ah perform maybe due to power failure ormaybe there there is some hardware failure or something of that sort badly failed nodesare like the failed nodes but in addition they sent some false routing messages whichbasically hurts the integrity or the you know which becomes a threat to the overall integrityof the network selfish nodes are basically the ones which are unwilling to cooperatethey do not want to cooperate so it is intentional misbehavior because they do not want to cooperatebecause there is some personal cost that is involved and packet dropping is one of theconsequences of not willing to cooperate so if a node which is acting a selfish receivesa packet instead of reeling it forward which it is supposed to do for successful operationof that particular network it is going to drop the packet and this is not desirableand then we have the malicious nodes which are basically you know which are like harmfulnodes which are a threat to the network which want to successful deliberately disrupt thesuccessful operation of the routing protocol or other protocols and thereby they do notwant to deliver the services that they are supposed to deliveranother type of dumb load which was recently very recently few years back only developedor identified not developed but identified by us in the swale lab is the dumb behaviorand we are the ones who basically detected the existence of this kind of misbehavingnode this is an unintentional misbehavior so in this kind of misbehavior unintentionalmisbehavior what happens is these sort of miss behaviors pop up whenever there is somechange in the environmental conditions maybe there is heavy rainfall maybe there is heavysnowfall maybe there is heavy fog and under those circumstances naturally as we know thereis you know signal problems that are going to happen so a node is going to sense a sensornode is going to sense but then it is not able to send it forward it is not able tocommunicate because of all these weather conditions or environmental conditions so that is the[re/reason] reason why the transceiver unit is not able to communicate at all or evenif the signal strength goes down drastically so what happens is that there is no node inthis facility so because there is no node in this facilityessentially it is the effect is that it is not able to communicate it is not able todelay it is not able to send the sensed information to another node because there is no such nodethe range has shrunk the range has decreased due to all these weather conditions and wehave coined the term dumb because these nodes basically behave like sort of you know somesort of ah you know behavior of ah dumb persons who can hear but who cannot speak out a disabilityok ah of these kind of differently abled persons because of which they are not able to theycan they can listen they can see everything but they are not able to speak out and becauseof this kind of mimicking behavior with these kind of nodes the sensor nodes we term thesenodes this behavior as the dumb behavior now this dumb behavior is transient it istemporary temporary means that it will last only for the duration when the weather conditionis bad now when the weather condition improves subsequently again the regular [com/communication]communication you know goes on so these sort of behavior unlike the other types of misbehaviorare only temporary in nature and that is why this is known as a dumb behavior only dumbbehavior unlike other kinds of misbehaviors intentional misbehaviors these are very temporaryin nature and you know they occur unintentionally so this is very important to understand nowwhat is required is to detect this kind of misbehavior and then you know offer connectivitythis reestablishment so if this kind of see what happens is whenever this kind of behavioroccurs in a sensor network this kind of behavior will not occur typically in other types ofnetworks because sensor networks are typically deployed in hertz in the environmental conditionsin environments where the ah you know be all these physical things ah change ah quite fastquite rapidly and so on so since the networks are typical in for deployment in these kindof environments so what is required is to detect this kind of misbehavior happeningin the network because ultimately what happens is the node which is not able to communicateit is completely cut off from the other nodes in the network so then how will it how inthe other nodes know that it is cut off so there has to be detected somehow so we workedon this particular issue of how to detect this kind of temporarily cut off nodes thedumb nodes and then how to establish some kind of connectivity even in the presenceof dumb behavior so that the normal network functions keep on running until the weatherconditions improve so two protocols cord and corad were proposedby us in the swain group and these protocols are available for further it is availableah in the netw[ork]- ah in the internet for further ah ah reading so if you search withthe cord and [co/corad] corad with few other suitable keywords you would be able to getaccess to these papers so these have been published in very prestigious ah venues likeacm transactions journal of systems and software of elsevier and so on next event aware topologymanagement in wellness sensor networks i also want it to give you a little bit of glimpseor flavor of this work this also has been done by ah us in the swale lab so here basicallyyou know we are talking about topology management so so topology management is primarily concernedabout how to not only establish but also how to manage the topology over time how to keepthe topology how to keep the networks the nodes in the network connected over time sothat they cant they can continuously sense and disseminate the data through them to thesink and adapting to the changes of the event state with respect to event location eventarea and event duration so this is what this particular work talksabout so i am not going to i am just going to give you little bit of ah idea about theseworks but i am not going to go through each of them in detail the corresponding referenceis given for you are already use if you are interested you know this paper you can pleasego through another paper also done ah along with ah my student shankar nayayan das isah this information theoretic self management of wireless sensor network this is a finework because you know in sensor networks one of the problems is periodically the nodesthis sense what is going on typically it is found that with respect to time it might sohappen that the information content of this different sensed packets they do not changemuch so why do you want to unnecessarily overload the network by communicating those packetswhere the information has not changed much so what is required is at the source detecthow much the currently sensed packet and the previously sensed one are correlated and thenthrough this measure which where where we are using advanced information theoretic conceptswe are identifying how much is the correlation between these sensed packets and then senddeciding upon which packet to send forward if [theri/they] they are sufficiently uncorrelatedyou sent the sensed packet otherwise you drop it you do not do anything further or queueit for sending it later or do something else this is one possibility other possibilityis that in a sensor networks typically the nodes are densely deployed now it might sohappen that two or more different nodes they have sensed data they have sensed data whichare sufficiently correlated then the point is that all those two or three different nodesif they all have similar kind of information content why do you all want to have thosethree packets to be sent forward to the sync because doing so will unnecessarily overloadthis highly constraint network so we have again used tools from information theory toah ah ah to basically address this particular issue so these ideas are very fundamentalto sensor networks and we have addressed those and i am trying to give you an exposure toall these different problems so that you know that if you have to use sensor networks foriot implementation what are the issues that have to be addressed for it it is not likebuying few iot devices few sensors few different other devices and putting them all togetherwe will have an iot network this is a common misconception implementation deployment ofiot is heavily research intensive it cannot be done ah ah in an ad hoc manner you haveto plan it properly and you have to design the protocols the design the algorithms findout the different complications that are going to happen and act accordingly going aheadso we have so i will skip ah it is [da/there] there for you this is part of the previousah information theoretic approach that i mention and finding the correlation between the differentpackets spatially as well as temporally so i am not going to go through it in detailbut it is available for you to go through in this particular slide another very importantthing is social sensing social networks like twitter facebook etcetera etcetera these arequite popular at the same time sensor networks are also quite popular but sensor networksduty cycling is very important because of these low powered nodes so low powered nodesmostly have to be kept in a dormant or a sleep mode and they have to be woken up periodicallynow when do you wake up do you wake them up after a certain interval of time or is therea better way of waking them up so we basically studied this issue and wehave seen that if the social ah sensor networks are hooked up to the sensor networks sorrysocial networks over the internet then we can exploit we can exploit the informationflow in these social networks to identify whether the sensing interval can be increasedor decreased may be that based on some you know cracking of the twitter data there isa straight to the national security so the sensor networks that are deployed in the coastin the water for naval defense or for aerial defense etcetera etcetera their duty cyclecan be increased accordingly so can be put in more alert but for rare events you do notneed to improve the duty you know increase the duty cycles so often you can keep themin a low duty cycle environment so this is what this third work basicallytalks about and the source of this literature is also given over here so you can if youare interested you may go through this particular but to understand how social networks andsensor networks can be integrate together in order to improve the performance of thesensor networks there are different challenges with social sensing distinguishing rare eventsand regular events adapting to the duty cycle with the event or occurrence probability andwhat we have done is probabilistically we determine how the duty cycle is going to bemanaged so we accumulate information from the social media to identify the occurrencepossibility of rare events and adjust the duty cycles of sensor nodes using some learningmachine learning approach again so in this particular figure we see that let us say thatthis is a military sensor network how this duty cycle is going to be changed over timeof this based on the data that is received from the web from social media sensor networkscan be used for a diverse range of applications for agriculture space applications miningand health care and so on and so forth here is an application of sensor network itfor mines in our country coal mining is very important and one of the ways of coal miningis basically the [bor/bord] bord and pillar coal mining b o r d bord bord and pillar coalmining so in the bord and pillar coal mining what happens is there are some columns thesepillars that are that are basically that is the way the structure of mining is done coalmining is done now in modern pillar coal mining so what we are saying is will be putting differentsensors so as to ensure that whenever there is a possibility of fire taking place it willget automatically detected and it will alert the respective persons and if indeed firetakes place then to you know through the actuators to release water pulps in pipes and so onand so forth so this particular paper whose source is givenover here basically talks about how to do it so these are the different columns thepillars and these are the the bord and the gallery these are the different bords andthe gallery and this is how the sensors are going to replace the temperature sensor thegas sensors and so on these are all going to be placed and where the actuators are goingto replace these are all shown over here in this particular now the other work is ah healthcarethe other application domain is healthcare in healthcare what happens is the humans arefitted with different physiological monitoring sensors sensors that will monitor physiologicalconditions with respect to body temperature blood pressure you know oxygen saturationin the blood you know cardio cardiac functionality a functioning and so on and so forthso when these sensors are all put together on the human body they can all sense aboutthat [physic/physiological] physiological functioning of that particular patient andsends you know send that sensed data to a local unit on the human body typically mobilephone kind of device which is technically known as the lpu the local processing unitso this becomes the lpu the coordinator so all these sensors we will be sending the sensedinformation to this particular coordinator and this becomes this unit because somethingknown as the w ban or wireless body area network and from here the data is sent to the ah youknow ah through the internet to the server for doctors to understand remotely the conditionof the patient a very important and an attractive concept is the concept of cloud assisted sensornetwork specifically in this particular paper we have talked about social choice considerationsin cloud assisted wireless body area network architecture for post disaster healthcareso concept of social choice theory of economics has been used in order to in order to impartfairness to the different nodes in the network in a cloud assistant w ban scenario w banis a sensor network a physiological monitoring sensor network and all this data in a w bancloud is going to go to the cloud end the physiological data are going to go to thecloud end now the question is that how do we ensure fairness among the different nodesin the network for that we have used the social choice theory for improving it a very importantwork that was done again in the swale lab is the work that is sited over here prioritizedpayload tuning mechanism for wireless body area based healthcare system this was publishedin i triple e globe com in two thousand fourteen so here basically we are using fuzzy logicin order to improve the tuning of payload in a w ban ok so conditions you know in additionto healthcare conditions there exist different other external parameters such as age heightweight gender of the patient and so on so all these also have to be taken into considerationso those are you know those can be ah you know those can be modeled better with thehelp of fuzzy logic fuzzy theory fuzzy set theory rather than using crisp set theoryand so what we had we have done is using ah the fuzzy fuzzy based concepts we have youknow taken all these things into consideration and have tried to improve the payload tuningof that particular network another important thing that also has to be taken into considerationwhen we are talking about healthcare sensor networks is that particularly during emergenciesyou know what happens is let us see that after a post disaster ah environment in a post disasterenvironment so so what happens if there are so many casualties so many victims and soon and so forth so and at the same time we have very limited medical resources be doctorsnurses paramedics and so on we have very limited so they all have to be taken care of now ifwe are using sensor networks you know deploying different sensors on the human body ah youknow of the patients victims and so on and so forth then what also has to be done isthat certain patients might require urgent attention more urgent attention compared tocertain other patients so that differentiation has to happen otherwise what might happenis some patient who is at the point of maybe collapsing or [dra/dying] dying he doesntget helped whereas somebody else who is not so critical get more attention so that fairnesshas to happen that priority has to be given and this particular paper which was publishedin the i triple e jb jbhi i triple e journal of biomedical and health informatics basicallytalks about it so we have in this particular lecture gonethrough different flavors of research works and applications of sensor networks we haveseen that how sensor networks can be used for the broader context of internet of thingsdeployment of sensor networks to achieve the objectives of internet of things this is whatwe have gone through in this particular lecture we have seen that there a there are lot ofapplications and we have also seen that there are lots of research issues some of the researchissues and their flavors is what you have been exposed to in this particular lecture thank you
