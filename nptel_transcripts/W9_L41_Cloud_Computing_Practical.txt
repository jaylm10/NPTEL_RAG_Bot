this is the fifth lecture in the series on cloud computing for internet of things inthis lecture you will learn about some of the basics about ah a an open source platformfor cloud which is open stack and in this lecture i will be assisted by one of the tasah mister anand shri and ah he will show you how to create ah ah you know it is not possibleto show you the installation of cloud or open stack ah specifically it is not a ah you knowpossible to show through this ah those installations are available the instructions for installationsare available ah you know through ah different links that are available publicly ah now onceyou have installed open stack then how to create ah virtual machine instances how toaccess those instances and so on so those manipulations how to do how to play aroundwith open stack interface so those things we are going to show in this particular lectureso this basically is going to give you a practical exposure of cloud with a popular open sourcesystem open stack and ah so this ah through this actually you can use open stack ah specificallyah with ah internet of things ah you know if you are building iot platforms and ah forcloud requirements you can use open stack ah for ithai every one my name anand shri and i am one of the tas of this course so today i amgone a do i am gone a ah tell you about some basics about ah open stacks so lets get startedhere first ah let us start with ah what actually is open stack so open stack is a softwarethrough which you can generate your own cloud and it is a joint project of the nasa andthe ah rackspace hosting and it was ah established in it was first released in ah two thousandten so right but right now so many ah companies so many big big companies are ah helping indeveloping the helping in developing the ah this ah software so some of the some of thecompanies are cisco ibm hp redhat and so on so obviously actually you can even contributein ah developing the software you can even ah develop your code that can ah upgrade thepresent open stack also so it is completely free and it is the only completely free opensource ah cloud developing software that is available in the market so some of the versionsof the open stacks are ah a listed here so ah it is a ah releasing order of the alphabeticalorders so ah it was a first it was two thousand and ten it was ah as ah austin but right nowthe latest version is ocata so lets go to the next slideso ah this are components of the open stack so in open stack there are so many componentsand its components are ah ah acting their own a function and its component has theirown specific functions a so first ah ah here is ah horizon this horizon is the dashboardsection from this horizon you can actually access other components so actually horizonis the gui interface of the software so it provide it provides gui sections it also provideoverview of the other components so when we ah when we do the practical section you willknow what the horizon isso ah next is the key stone key stone is actually the authentication and authorizon system sowhen a user access the system or when when a user access the cloud this keystone willbe able to detect ah if this ah user is authentic or if this user is authorized to use the ahresources that he is attempting to use so next next component is a nova nova is thecompute service actually nova is the component where we are going to launch the instancesand all so and the glance glance is the email serviceso ah for installing ah the instances we need images so for this we will use glance so itis also useful in discovering registering retrieving those a vm ware also and throughthis ah glance we can also give the snap shots ah so that we can use the ah snap shot laterfor the ah installation of the other vms also and next is the swift swift is full objectstorage so ah swift helps in the storing data safely cheaply and efficiently so obviouslyit is also written on the ah slide alsoso the next is the neutron neutron is one of the most important part of the open stackbecause it is the it it is the networking part of the system it provides the networkingservice of the ah a softwares so through this we can access other components and throughthis we can access ah different different ah instances and and then neutron you canah create your own networks you can modify your own networks and we can say it as a neutronis providing like the ah network as a service so ah next component is the cinder cinderis also a storage but it is the block storage like ah it is something like pluggable typeof storage and then next is the ah hear and the hear provide orchestrationso and the next is the ceilometer ceilometer is the billing section like ah through theceilometer one can ah one can ah monitor what resource is using and for how long the resourcesis using so billing is actually helpful in ah helpful for the ah cloud service providerslike a we can monitor ah which user is using which resources and for how long he he isusing the resources and according to the time and the type of resources we can build themwe can say how much resources that he is using how much costs for thatso next is so lets ah get started the installation part so actually ah in the installation thereare many steps like a we can also install manually like we can ah make our own vms andthen install it again and it is quite ah ah difficult so there are script devstack throughwhich we can easily install the ah ah install the cloud like all this open stack ah in thisdevstack the installation steps are already written in the form of the devstack file sowe can directly run the file and everything will be run by the script itselfso while installing the file we may face some problems like ah a proxy problem then it canthe solving those kind of ah problem is already find already available in the internet alsoso lets ah here here also i am showing how to solve it using the devstack so devtacksscript is found in ah ah a git ah dot open stack dot org ah a website so you can easilyclone from there and you can a clone then and you can access it easily so in order toclone it ah we have to first ah install the git ah softwaresso in order to it just ah perform the steps that i have given there like ah installationpart just go to the ah command and after that just clone it and after that go to the directorylike this so lets go to the a machine where the cloud is installed and see what is itshowing so lets go there so it is running here so actually ah this ah this devstackfolder is clone in the home directory so lets see what is in the home directory so we cansee there there is ah arduino labs devstack ya devstack ya so we will go to this folderso inside it so inside it there will be so many files ah so we just need to a we needto run this ah dot stack dot sh file so lets run it ah write so it is saying that it isalready installed already running there this stack so it means i have already the installedthe cloud in my ah server it means we i dont need to install it so for for the installationpart just ah go to the step and you will be able to install itso ah for the installation go to a ah there is some settings like a go to the local dotconfig file and set this ah settings and run the dot sh file stack dot sh file for andfor the uninstallation just run the unstack dot sh file so after that lets go to the ahactual cloud and see some working about how to lower the instance and how to delete ithow to access the instance and all so lets go to the cloud go here ah i will be accessingas a admin this password is a password that you set during the installation part so youshould remember the password and you should remember the username also only through thepassword and username you should be able to access this ah admin a section so successiveso this is the this is the horizon this is the horizon of the ah open stack means thisis the gui part of the sectionso through this gui part we can access to different components like ah instance instancesobviously the a glance part like a network networking is obviously the ah ah neutronpart so lets get started with the ah creation of the ah key keys ah user keys it will berequired for the ah launching of the instance ah so first lets ah create the key pair soit should be start with the you just go click the input key pair and here is the commandfor ah crating a key pair so just copy it and go there and ya lets copy it and makesome ya like this is the name of the key you should remember this key in order to accessyour ah ah instance ah ya ya test two so just double click it so key is already createdso we want to access the key already the key should be created here after we create a keyso lets go create the key first lets access the key so this is the ah generated key actuallythis is the rsa generated key so copy it copy the key and ah go there gives some name thiswill be the name of your key pair ok so lets give it test test two and ah place your thegenerated rsa key here so after that import the key so so we can see that the key is alreadygenerated so through this key this actually this key is generated using your keystonelike this is the authentication part in authorizing part so this key is doing the authenticationand authorization part of the ah cloud so ah lets go to ok go to instance and lets launchan instance so lets give the name of the instance like test two so this is the name of the instanceyou should give the name of the instance anything you like and after that go to next and selectga image this is the curros image this is the only image i have right now ah next ahnext time ah in ah others ah in the sometime we will be discussing about the how to createthe a image and all so lets ah lets launch this instance first so you if it added thengo to next and you just select ah one of nameso you should be some you should select it carefully so so you wont be able you so thatyou your instinctively happens ah you will run smoothly as well as it wont consume thename of your ah server also so for this curros ah this i will select this tiny and afterthat next and what is network this is already i have created this network already so letsselect this one and go to the network port and this security pair security group itsalready default and after that ah security pair so this is the security key that we havegenerated just nowso so now we can launch the instance so lets seeit is scheduling it is installing it will take some time ok it is active now it is ahit is already launched so lets say if we can access this lets see if we can access thisah instance the instance is here so lets say if we can ping this instance ah the ip ofthe instance is this ah ten dot three dot thirty six three dot six so lets see if wecan ping so i think it wont be able to ping i willexplain you later so lets exit it and lets set some rules and allso first ah we havent connect this ah ah this instance to any ah external ip so if we dontconnect it to external ip then we wont be able to access the other other outside environmentyou wont be able to access it so ah lets ah create lets see the network topology firstso ah we can see that this is our instance so test two is a instance and this is ourah ah this is our network so and this is the public so until we connect this ah instanceto the public we the outside environment or the ah the inner environment whenwe intercommunicate with each otherso what we need to do is first we need to create a router so lets create a router createa router ok lets give some name like router one router one so so it is created routerand we can see that from network topology the router is already created it is createdhere so all we need to do is connect this ah public offset public port to the routerand then connect this router to the this ah network so lets do itso go to the router and to go to the interface and at interface select your network thisis dc this is a network network so submitted and your ah your network is connected to therouter so right now what we need to do is ah is connect the outside world to the routerok lets do it already done so lets see the network topologyso so we can see that the router is connected to the inner world and the outer world soright now this outer world should be able to ping to the inner world or should be ableto connect with the inner world so lets check if it is connecting or not ok again its notagain its not connecting also so why it is it so lets check it because we havent setany security rule so lets do it so for setting up the security rule go to the access andsecurity and go to the security group and minus the rule so so we can see that thereis an any role that is related to pinging for pinging the rules would be icmp rightso lets add the rule from here select the icmp and edit so or our rule is added so wecan we lets see it whether it is accessible from the outside world again it is not sowhy because we havent set any floating ip that means our instance is not connected tothe to the outside world unless you know we have to set the ah floating ip so lets editgo to instance ok go there associate floating ip and ok letgenerate one a new one ok it is generated and associated okso we can see that there is another ip this is the floating ip of your instance so throughthis floating ip outside world should be able to access this instance so lets see it ifis actually accessible or not lets copy the floating ip ok so lets ping it right so wecan see that we can able to ping it it means we are able to access these instance fromthe outside world it is a good thing so ah lets go here and this is accessible and wecan check if it is ah lets ah set another rule lets add another rule like lets see ifit isso we are not able to ssh the instance so for this we also need to get another ah ruleso lets add it from here select the ssh rule and edit so we should be able to access itchanged ok ok resolved it ah copyok now we can access the so yes so right now password what the key is so here we are ableto access this from the outside world also we are able to access it from the outsideworld also so this is how we generated and how we create the instance so right now letsah go to the a neutron part lets go a bit deeper to the neutron part ok so so lets delaythese instance for a time being so that it wont consume much name of the ah hosting serverright ok ah lets launch ok dc ok ok lets launch two instance ok flavor tiny see if you removethis we dont need it nowso this launches instance and lets create another network so i will show you how tocreate a network here so for creating a network just click the create network and after thatgive a name like marvels yeah marvels and go to next yeah you should click this ah createsub net part and go to next and give a sub net name like marvel sub and after that youshould give a network address ten dot zero dot like ok four dot zero slash ah ten foryou should give the ah this subnet in the form of ah cider notation so lets go nextand you should click this dhcp and after that create it should be created hence in a whileok its gone a take a while okso we have a marvel and we have the dc so lets connect this network so lets connectthe ah ah instances that is created inside this marvel part and the dc part so ah letscreates another instances it is taking a bit longer than expected ok lets access this fromhere so so instance lets refresh it it should not take this long its taking here also samehere ok its coming so we have generated two instances one is the lantern one and thenanother is a lantern twoso lets launch another two instances lets call it guardians ok so lets select the sameand lets go to the next and select the your flavors selected next and select the marvelnext next next so we dont need this key right now so just launch it its gone a take a whileso ya this is guardians and this ah instances under your marvel ah network and this lanternsis under the dc network so it is creating so lets wait for a while ok ok it is createdso lets go to the network topology and check it if a check the network topology here soit is loading lets wait for a while ya we can see that this is your lanterns and thisis your marvels these are not connected so that means we wont be able to access thisah pc this guardians from this lanterns because they are not connected okso lets check if it is ah you know ah accessible or not ok lets go from here and lets go tothe lantern ok ok like go to the console go to the console ok here ok for the cirros thisis the password just so it is ok sorry ok login as cirros and password is a cup swinso we are under this cirros so it is the lantern two so lets check if it is you know we canaccess the guardians from the lanternlets check the guardians ok what is the ip of the guardians lets check it so ip of theguardian is this so lets copy it and lets check if it is accessible or not ok lets gohere and ping ten dot zero dot four dot three so it is not accessible so we should set youknow we should connect the two networks so lets do it lets do it so go to the networkgo to the router so router is already created so go to the router and add interface at themarvels here so here so here we can see that from a network topology this two worlds arealready connected so right now the two should be able to connect to each other so lets checkif it is able to connect it or not so right now we can see that the two networks are ableto connect so this how you set your ah neutron is how you set up your network and this isall so lets end here ah this session so so these are the references andthank you
