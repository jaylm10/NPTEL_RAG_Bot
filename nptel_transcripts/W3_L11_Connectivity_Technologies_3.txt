for connectivity we have already gone through different technologies which offer communicationin iot technologies such as zigbee six low pan and the like they are based on eitherthey use either they are developed on top of eight zero two point fifteen point fourfor instance the way zigbee has been developed or they use eight zero two point fifteen pointfour standard the way six low pan does likewise there are other technologies which are sortof derived from or are based upon the i triple e eight zero two point fifteen point fourtechnologies such as hart h a a h a r t and wireless hart are two such technologies thatwe are going to cover in this particular lecture so hart the full form of ah the full formof hart is highway addressable remote transducer protocolso highway addressable remote transducer protocol h a r t and its latest version which is awireless version of it which is a wireless hart are two such technologies which are sortof derived from eight zero two point fifteen point four standard so all these eight zerotwo point fifteen point four standard based technologies and the protocols they are veryuseful for setting up iot communication the reason is that they enable short range ahyou know different data rate communication between low power devices as are found iniot systems so we will go through the hart and the wirelesshart and the overview of it to understand how it functions and what are its differentfeatures so the genesis of hart and wireless hart goes back to industrial iot iiot industrialiot which is again one of the lectures that we are going to have in the future in thisparticular course so for many of these industrial applications such as industrial plants orvehicular networks connected vehicular etcetera etcetera so what is required is to set upsome kind of is ah network between different field devices to form a smart system a smartnetwork and this is what is required in iot so hart basically helps in the same way aszigbee does for establishing connectivity between different iot devices and the specialthe special focus of hart is on industrial applications so the hart protocol has beendesigned and is implemented in such a way so that it becomes cheaper and easier to implementin an iot system so hart basically [en/encompasses] encompasses the most number of field devicesincorporated in any iot network so talking about hart and wireless hart it basicallyhelps to ensure accessibility of different devices and the placement of such devicesin such a way that it becomes cheaper to develop the overall system the system becomes overallefficient and typically this protocol is implemented on top of a reaction tank inside a pipe orat widely separated warehouses to have connectivity between these different components or differentparts of the warehouse or the reaction tank or the pipes etceteraso the main difference between hart and the wireless hart is in the physical data linkand network layers so the wireless hart and the hart they are almost the same except thatthere are certain differences in these specific layers of physical data link and network andwe are going to go through them in a little bit more detail so we have to also keep inmind that wired hart basically doesnt have support for a network layer so looking athart and the wireless hart what we have is a physical layer data link layer network layertransport layer and application layer so the physical layer as i said is derivedfrom the basic standard the most popular standard for iot implementation the eight zero twopoint fifteen point four i triple e standard and this protocol the hart protocol ah functionsin the ism band but more specifically the two four gigahertz ism band it implies andexploits fifteen channels of the band in this particular ism band to increase the reliabilityof the network so thats the physical layer with support for eight zero two point fifteenpoint four derived reduced then comes the data link layer the data link layer has aconcept of something known as the super frames and the super frame basically helps in ensuringreliable communication collusion free and deterministic communication between the differentnodes of the network and it is based on this particular layer it works ah using a tdmalike protocol time division multiple access protocol where there are different time slotswhen the ah different devices are able to communicate in those allotted time slotsso these super frames that we are talking about they are grouped into ten millisecondwide time slots and the super frames basically control the timing of transmission to ensurecollision free and reliable communication this layer the data link layer incorporateschannel hopping and channel blacklisting to increase the reliability and security howis it done how is the reliability and security increased because there is channel hoppingso ah you know what happens is a transmission takes place in one of the channels then basicallythe the transmission takes over in another channel at the next time instant so thereis basically channel hopping there is something similar to ah you know oh what happens infrequency hopping ah ah ah frequency hopping spread spectrum so a similar kind of approachis adopted in this particular ah um ah case as wellso because there is channel hopping at different time instance etcetera that improves the securityyou know and also improves the system from being hacked network from being hacked ahah by different intruders or malicious agents channel blacklisting basically what it doesis it identifies the channels consistently affected by interference and removes themfrom use now looking at the network and transport layers after the physical and the data linklayers we see that these two layers they cooperatively handle various [trypes/types] types of [trapi/traffic]traffic routing session creation and security functions wireless hart is based on the meshnetworking in communication so a mesh network at the network layer isset up using wireless hart and each device is primed at different time instants to forwardpackets for every other device each device in wireless hart is armed with an updatednetwork graph that means the topology gets updated at subsequent time time instants andthat way ah ah the that particular topology is used to handle routing so the network layerin hart basically consists of the osi network layer the transport layer and the sessionlayers put them together and that is what is the network layer of the hart or wirelesshart protocol application layer in hart handles communication between gateways and devicesvia a series of command and response messages so there are different command messages responsemessages and a chain of such message flows take place to implement the application layerthis application layer is responsible for extracting commands from a message executingit and generating responses so in [egs/extract] extract the commands from the message executethose commands and then respond to those commands so this layer is seamless and does not differentiatebetween the wireless and wired versions of hartso irrespective of what is down underneath in the different ah bottom bottom layers asi said that there is certain difference between the hart and the wireless hart protocols atthe network layer transport layer data link layer and the physical layer in fact as isaid before pure hart the wired hart doesnt even have the network layer implemented soessentially the most of most of the difference comes in the other three layers which is basicallythe physical layer the data link layer and the transport layer now one of the very importantissues of use of hart or any such like protocol is how do you handle congestion so congestionis basically handled in different ways so we are talking about a two four gigahertzism band with channels ah with channel twenty six ah removed from itso there is no channel twenty six due to the restricted use of this particular channelin certain areas so the so what we have is interference prone channels avoided by usingchannel switching post every transmission the transmission is synchronized using tenmillisecond slots during each such slot all available channels can be utilized by thevarious nodes in the network allowing for the propagation of fifteen packets throughthe network at a time which also minimizes the risk of collisions so this is how congestionah is controlled collisions are avoided and not avoided but minimized and so on wirelesshart uses a something known as the network manager agent the network manager agent superviseseach node in the network and guides them when and where to send the packet when to sendthe packet and where what is the intended destination so this is what is the job ofthe network manager entity in the wireless hart it allows for this network manager allowsfor collision free and timely deliver your packets between a source and the destinationthe network manager updates the information about the neighbors the single strength andthe information needing delivery of receipt so wireless hart basically uses somethingcalled known as the code based network security to prevent from unauthorized access or unauthorizedattempts of different nodes from joining the network now as i in started at the very beginningthat these are all like you know protocols like zigbee or ah you know ipv six or wirelesshart the the ipv six protocol has a [li/little] little bit of different ah you know ah [fa/functionality]functionality ah from these protocols but you know if you look at all these protocolsthey are all meant for use in low power low specification resource constraint bandwidthconstraint networks and this is where their usefulness in iot comes into pictureso we now need to compare between for instance the popular zigbee protocol and the wirelesshart one thing is zigbee is primarily consumer based iot you know zigbee is primarily usedfor consumer based iot whereas hart is primarily used for industrial iot applications althoughnobody limits the use of either of these protocols for consumer or ah ah or industrial applicationdomains so they can be used interchangeably but primarilythey are based on their implementations consumer iot zigbee and industrial iot hart and wellnesshart so going back a wellness hart node basically hops after every message and that as i saidbefore improves the security of systems from being attacked or from unauthorized accessto the network zigbee does not feature hopping at all on the contrary and it only hops whenthe entire network hops so this is one of the primary points of difference between zigbeeand wireless hart now at the mac layer wireless hart utilizes tdma allotting different timeslots for each transmission on the other hand zigbee is primarily based on the mac protocolcsma plus so csma cd or csma ca so csm a class of protocols so zigbee is basedon csma class of protocols contention based protocols and ah ah and tdma is basicallyapplied in the case of wireless hart in wireless hart what is used is the mesh network topologywhere each node is capable of serving as a router so that if one node goes down anothernode can replace it so that basically in fact this mesh networking topology improves theoverall delivery reliability of packet delivery in the network zigbee use utilizes a treetopology which makes nodes along the trunk criticalwireless hart devices are all backwards compatible and that basically allows for the integrationof legacy devices as well as the new one so this is one of the very important and attractivefeatures behind using wireless hart because you do not have to totally forget the legacyand the contemporary systems because it is backwards compatible you can use wirelesshart in conjunction to the [lega/legacy] legacy systems and protocols zigbee devices sharethe same basis for their physical layers but zigbee zigbee pro zigbee r fo ah rf four ce and zigbee ip or otherwise incompatible with each other so this is also a very attractiveor important difference between zigbee and wireless hartanother very important technology is nfc and this nfc technology as you will see shortlyhas lot of similarities with the rfid rfid are also based on something known as magneticinduction magnetic induction between the card reader that means the rfid card reader andthe rfid tag rfid card and in the case of nfc as well we will see that there is a similarityof this sort so nfc one ah the full form of nfc is near field communication and this isbasically as i said is very similar to the rfid technology and this is something therfid technology is something that we have discussed previously in a previous lectureso nfc is designed for use by devices within the close proximity to each other all nfctypes are similar but communicate in different ways so a very allied nfc technology whichis known as the felica is commonly found and is used mostly in japan the contemporary onestype a and type b nfcs are used in the rest part of the world there are different primarilytwo types of nfc devices one is the passive device and the other one is the active devicepassive devices are more common than the active devices active devices are typically implementedin smartphones and so on so you have an nfc support along with yoursmartphone in which are basically you know ah these nfc s that are implemented in thesmartphones are basically active collectors of ah ah of information and they are alsoactive transceivers you know rather transmitters of the information so we have active devicesan example as i as i just said is the use of nfc in ah ah you know active nfcs in smartphonesand all the passive devices are typically used in nfc tags and so on and these are verysimilar to the rfid tags and very similar kind of technology which is based on magneticinduction these rfc tags sorry these nfc tags they contain information which is readableby other devices however it cannot read information itself and these nfcs like in the case ofrfids are typically used and are implemented in supermarkets so as i was just saying ina short short while back nfcs are based on the physical principle the scientific principlebehind the [function/functioning] functioning of nfcs is the concept of magnetic inductionso here basically there is a nfc reader which emits a small electric current which createsa magnetic field which in turn bridges the physical space between the devices so youbring the nfc reader ah close to the nfc device there is a magnetic induction that basicallygoes on between these two entities and that is how the information that is encoded inthese nfc tags are [trans/transmitted] transmitted ah are sent to the nfc reader the reader basicallyemits a small electric current which creates a magnetic field that in turn bridges thephysical space between the devices this is what i will just saying short while backthe generated field this magnetic field is received by a similar coil in the client devicewhere where where it is turned back into electrical impulses to communicate data such as identificationnumber status information ah status information or any other information nfc tags are usedin the case of supermarkets and similar kind of libraries etcetera etcetera they use theenergy from the reader to encode their response while the active or peer to peer tags havetheir own power source so in this particular figure this particular physical or scientificprinciple that i just mentioned is shown over here so what we have pictorially as it isshown what we have is the nfc card so this has some magnetic coil kind of andthen we have this nfc reader through which current is passed so a magnetic field is generatedand that is how the information transfer between these two entities the card as well as thecard reader takes place the nfc specification nfcs data transmission frequency is thirteenpoint five six ah sorry megahertz nfc can ah can transmit data at the rate of eitherone zero six two one two or four two four kbps thats typically stored between ninetysix and five hundred twelve bytes of data and the communication range is less than twentycentimeters there are primarily three modes of operationof nfc the first is the peer to peer mode the second is the read write mode and thethird is the card emulation mode in the peer to peer mode two smartphones they can forexample swap data between themselves and this is this particular mode which helps thesetwo smartphones to be able to exchange the data between themselves the read write [move/mode]mode here one active device picks up information from a passive oneso active device from passive device picking up information is an example of read writemode of operation and card emulation the nfc device can be used like a contactless creditcard so in credit cards also and very similar to the way it is done so in credit cards alsoyou know these kind of things are implemented the rfcs are implemented so that what youhave is payment through these nfa enabled credit cards so there is a contactless creditcard ok so these nfc basically makes it contactless the functioning of nfc basically makes itcontactless so we have three modes of operation the peer to peer mode the read write modeand the card emulation mode so i already mentioned about payments using smartphones parcel trackinginformation tags in posters and advertisements computer game synchronized toys low powerhome automation systems these are all different examples of nfc applications nfc reader thecard and the nfc reader being used for all these different types of applications is somethingthat makes [nf/nfc] nfc very useful and effective for iot applicationsso to conclude what we have gone through are primarily two protocols the hart and its wirelessvariant the wireless hart and nfc which is the near field communication in hart and wirelesshart basically there are the layers physical layer the data link layer network layer transportlayer and application layer hart the wired hart basically does not have [they/it] itdoesnt have the network layer wireless hart does and wireless hart basically works ontop of the i triple e eight zero two point fifteen point four or rather to be more preciseand correct wireless hart works as a derived protocol from the eight zero two point fifteenpoint four it is derived from eight zero two point fifteenpoint four because it has different features that i have been suggested in eight zero twopoint fifteen point four and is implemented over here in hart and wireless hart ratherwhereas in nfc nfc basically works very similar to rfids and you have an nfc reader and anfc card and there is magnetic ah ah coupling that ah you know magnetic ah induction thathelps these two entities to transfer information between them to read information let us sayfrom the card to the reader so these are all very attractive technologies that can be usedfor implementing internet of things thank you
