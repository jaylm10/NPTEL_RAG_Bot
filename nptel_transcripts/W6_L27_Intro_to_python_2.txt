hello in this lecture in continuation to python programming i will be covering a few interestingapplications you can develop using normal python programming so to start off with wewill be covering a few basic operations starting from file read write operations ah we willbe dealing with normal text files as well as csv files csvs are basically comma separatedvalue files so each value in the file is separated by a commanext we will move on to your developing a network socket using python scripting so wewill develop two parts ah first we will develop a udp host or a server and a udp client andin the third part we will be dealing with some basic image read write operations usingpython pil library so to start off with ah the file read write operations as necessaryin normal iot based applications ah imagine your senses or lots and lots of sensors areuploading the data on a particular database or a file systemso the data is separated ah separately stored or data is collectively stored using varioustime stamps or signatures or identifiers it may be in a text file for small scale systemsit may be in a csv file for but larger scale systems and then again for much larger implementationsof iot people normally prefer using data bases like mysql or oracle cetera so python allowsus the functionality to read and write filesah generally no external module or library is required it is available with the basicdistribution of python itself and while reading or writing a file ah three basic steps haveto be followed first and foremost is opening a file itself next is reading or writing operationand third one is closing the file so keeping these three in mind we will dive into a bitmore details about theseso the open function is used to open a file and returns a file object that means wheneveryou give the syntax open first argument is filename and the second argument is mode thethere are the following four modes r for read or w for write a for append and r plus forboth read as well as write modes through reading from a file as you can see the syntax is prettysimpleso imagine you have a file text file named data data dot txt so we are going to attemptto open it using this line file equal to open data dot txt comma r ah point to notice boththe filename as well as the mode are within quotations because these are taken as stringsand then ah in the next line we have file dot read so this file equal to open functionthe file is actually a variable you can assign any other name to it next is the writing toa file partso whenever we are writing to a file again we have to open the file only the mode changesfrom r to w then file dot write and within arguments you just put in the string hereabout to write to the file you can obviously put various variables you can store your incomingsensor data and some variable and iteratively write those variables using the file dot writefunctionnow at the end once a file access has been done you must ensure that your file handleis closed by using this function file dot close and whenever ah since normally in normalscenarios specially iot based scenarios there is a significant need to iteratively accessthe same file over and over again so ah using this script with open data dot txt in writemode as file in file dot write we write the string which has to be written to the textfile and then we release the file handle by calling file dot closedso it would be better if we give a bit of hands on to this thingso as you can see i have already kept the program ready so we just have to call a fileany file name we want to put over here we have python program dot txt we can changeit to something else also so my files and folders basically recite in this directoryso as you can see there is no python program dot txt file in this list so maybe we canjust change the name to live demo dot txtthen in the next line for speed iteratively we have to write something on it so with openlive demo the txt as w or in write mode as file lets call it by another name file onethen file one dot write we are writing this writing data abc and then we release the filehandle by calling file one dot close so once we run this thing so we have executed thisthing this these three lines of code ah again we will check the directoryhere we have the file named as live demo dot txt we open it as you can see the intendeddata has been written to the text file so this was part one half of the job it is readingah that is writing to the file next part comes that is reading from that file so now i havea filename live demo dot txt so in the same manner as before i will open the same textfile but in read mode so i will change the mode to r initial it was w now changing itto rso i am opening the file mode in read opening the file in reading mode assigning the variablelet us call let file one or maybe just for the sake of it file two f equal to file twodot read then i print reading from the file and then again i print whatever has been readand again i release the file handle i release this file to by calling file two dot closeso once again i will execute these linessee once this execution is complete the first line has been printed reading from the filethis was a first print statement and then if you recall we had earlier written writingdata to the text file like writing data abc so this has been extracted from the text fileand put up and printed on the console so this was part one reading and writing from normaltext files so they can be multiple operations we can consider while doing file read writeoperationsso not to go into that much details you can easily avail various resources online to checkthose another common thing being used is this csv file format or comma separated valuesyou can again check i dont have any csv file in my directory list so i am using this scriptcsv read write or py so once this has been executed it will generate a file with theextension dot csvfor this i have to import an external library or csv library once this library has beenimported i define the data i want to write to the file first i will write to the filethen once the file has been created and the data written to it i will read from that samefile so one point to remember is whenever i am trying to open a file in write mode ifthe file does not already exist the system will automatically create that file that samefileso i am giving the file name as output dot csv lets name the variable as file one thedata is within since we are putting up a string data so we are giving one two three four uptonine and we split it using the comma character you can use other characters also like semicoloncolon so on but for the sake of demonstration i am just using a comma lets see what happenswhen i execute this line so this script has been executed i will check what is storedin thisso you can see individually you have various strings separated by comma the first stringis one comma second string is two comma and so on upto nine so whatever input you hadgiven it has been individually separated into substrings then next i open the i create avariable file one and try to open output dot csv so in this directory we have nothing calledan output dot csv fileso ah we are assigning this output dot csv string to variable file one now again usingwith open file one in write mode as csv file we call another variable writer equal to csvdot writer in csv file delimiter is comma suppose you had given a semicolon as delimiteryou could have replace this comma by a semicolon and we print a normal statement to check whetherit is working fine or not and then whatever data is being written into the fileso we ah we call the writer again and each row report in a separate value like one inthe first row two in the on the second row three on the third row and so on then eventuallywe call the close function file dot close now lets see what happens when the when werun this collectively so my print statement writing csv has been executed lets check sothe file name was output dot csv yes we have a file called output dot csv over hereso by default it is opening with microsoft excel so for my system the default csv fileviewer is microsoft excel so its directly opening through excel the will take some timelet it load in the meanwhile will look into this writing from a csv file part now againwe go on with with open in a name variable file one in read mode as csv file and readerequal to csv reader csv filewe print that it is reading from a file that is we will just give a indicator to the userthat this script is executing and then for each row being read by the reader the valuebeing read will be printed one at a time and eventually we will release the handle by callingthe filename dot close functionso i have finally managed to open my excel file as you can see the values one two threefour have been written in separate columnsso we instead of these static values we can acquire data from various sensors and we cankeep on updating this csv file in a iterative manner so this will give me a database a rudimentarydatabase ok now i know my output dot csv file is in place i will try reading from that filenow the first after the script has finished executing the first print statement was readingfrom the csv file and it has read the values individually like one to nine so i hope thiswas quite easy will move on to the next partso we have already completed these now the next part is a but interesting since it willdeal with various images so will functionally work with image read write operations nowpython supports this library called pil or python imaging library this is generally usedfor image related operations so if by default your pil is not on the system we use pil orwe acquire pil using sudo pip install pillowso normally pil is is supported in the python version two point seven till two point sevenotherwise for higher versions ah pillow needs to be installed to get this working so forimage read write operations first of all we have to call this pil library either we importpil directly or if we have any particular function in mind like the function image wejust import that particular functionso for that we have from pil import image then opening that image file image equal toimage dot open name of the image and for displaying the image we just write image dot show soyou have multiple functions related to images you want to resize your image you call theresize function and within arguments you give the number of rows and columns you want torotate your image you call rotate and within arguments the degrees you want to rotate yourimage also you can convert between various colour mapsso for example you can convert your normal images acquired from standard cameras we callthem as rgb images because of the presence of three channels red green and blue we canconvert this into grey scale also so the conversion function is pretty simple image dot convertand within the arguments ah within quotes you write that mode l stands for pay scaleand rgb stands for the normal rgb mode so you can alternatively convert between thesetwoso this is just for the sake of demonstration see for example once we execute this scriptwill come to that in the hands on part once we execute the script it will give you thefollowing output the left hand side this image was taken as the input image and after conversionusing image dot convert function it has converted to your grey scale so will check out thisfunctionso now i have from pil import image and assigning a variable to the function image dot openso i have a input image i three dot jpeg in my folders same folder as the script theni execute this im dot show i will just execute these three lines you see once the im dotshow has been executed the default image viewer application of your system opens up and thiswas this is the input image null convert it to grey scaleso im dot convert and within quotes l and again last the system to show the image soas you can see again on the default image doing application the image has been convertedto grey scale from rgb now i need to save this image so since the converted colour mapof the grey scale image is stored in a variable grey underscore image i need to save thisgrey underscore image dot save and the name i want to save it asso once save function has executed i get the required file in my directorythese are just some of the very basic functions i can work with next will move on to basicnetworking in python so for this will create udp sockets so will try to simulate two systemslike you will have a client and then you will have a server so server will expect data fromthe client later on you can actually now itself you can actually imagine your client to bedeployed iot devices which read various sensorial data and transmit it over the network to theserver it works in a same principleso for starters will just see how this networking part happens so maybe your server is locatedfar apart but connected to the network using this same code same principle with a bit ofmodifications you can get your field deployed iot devices to send data to a remotely locatedserver so python provides this network services using the client server model and then thissocket support in operating system it allows the clients to implement serversit allows the implementation of clients and servers for both tcp ip that is connectionoriented as well as udp protocols which are mainly connectionless protocol and pythonhas additionally libraries which allow higher access to specific application level networkprotocols so general syntax is locating the socket a variable which is equal to socketdot socket in socket family socket type protocol by default the protocol is zero so withinsocket family you have af underscore unix or af underscore inetso generally unix option is only available for unix base systems where as i net standfor all internet protocols socket type is sock stream or sock datagram and protocolby default is zero so we have created a tcp ip socket we give the server address as thisis a particular ip address then we give a particular port to which server your clientwill bind and just some print statements and eventually the main functions sock dot bindand server addressso that this will be listening for connections and then we have sock dot listen this initializesthe listening part that the server is expecting connections from client so it would be betterif i give a demonstration of this thingso i will need two consoles for this from one i will run the server from another i willrun the client so this is my socket server for the server address i have given a normalloopback address that is one two seven dot zero dot zero dot onei given a random port ten thousand and one and we intend to write the data which is beinggenerated into a text file so data log dot txt in write mode and this data socket willbe expecting the data which is it receives from the client in junks of four zero ninesix bytes and whenever this data is received it will convert the data to string and writethe data to the file and eventually once the transaction has finished it will close thefileso till this part the socket operations take place and within this the data read writeoperation take place similarly ok for start i will get the server running so it does notshow anything because it is expecting data from a client on the client side i give thesame loopback address as the server then the same port number it is very important to havethe same port numbersnow with try and finally we just iteratively loop again and again and send two values hand t i have fixed it to two and three and this will keep on sending these values overthe socket you see this sent equal to this sock dot sent to message the message thatis two comma three to the server address that was this loopback address so in the secondconsole i will run the client you see the client is sending two three two three it willkeep on sending this until i terminate the execution and at the server side you are receivingthis two and threeso this thing you can implement on two different machines connected to the network it may bein the same room it will be in different cities it may be in different countries but yourserver your ip and port needs to be the same so we have covered this client you have seenthe code for stand and outputs you have seen so i hope you can now use this knowledge togenerate some interesting applications on pythonthank you
