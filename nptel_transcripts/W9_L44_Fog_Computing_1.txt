in a previous lecture we discussed about cloud computing and its importance in ah internetof things so cloud is very important because you see that internet of things iot devicessensors r f i d devices and so many different types of devices this sends so much of dataand finally those data have to be handled and that is the reason that a cloud came intopicture that all these data will be sent to the cloud for further processing and so onand so forth now the main problem with ah cloud in internet of things environment isthat latency so what is meant by latency i will explain to you before we go formallyabout discussing the concept of fog is a that let us say that we have a cloud and we havedifferent iot devices deployednow what we have discussed when we were talking about cloud computing in the context of internetof things is that each of these devices they sent all these data to cloud for further processingand storage for further processing and storage now thats a problem thats a problem becauseyou see this iot environments this iot environments number one are constraint in different wayswith respect to bandwidth with respect to processing with respect to memory with respectto energy and so and so forthnow this processing can be handled with the help of cloud but what about the bandwidthwhat about the energy consumption because what is going to happen in this sort of scenarioof use of cloud in the iot context is lot of data is going to float all around overthe network lot of data through the internet are going to be sent to the cloud and thatwill unnecessarily consume the bandwidth that will also consume unnecessarily the limitedenergy that is resident in all this devices and so on so we do not want to do that becausecommunication consumes most of the energy so we do not want unnecessary communicationsto take place and even if we do we have to limit even if we have to communicate and thatis required because in a network basically iot is basically a network so in network communicationis required but how do we handle it efficiently this is what we are going to ah ah discussin this particular lecture so can we do something which is better than cloudso this is where fog comes into picture fog was ah introduced by cisco and ah so it wassort of like an idea about how to being the cloud facilities close to the iot devicesbecause as we saw that you know we have to have ah you know all these data sent to thecloud that will ah ah you know that will not only take the bandwidth limited bandwidththat is ah there in this kind of environment but also that is going to take lot of timeso that is going to take lot of time so in this particular case the time that is requiredwill be the time from when that event is sensed that peace of data is sent to the cloud sothis one let us say this is t one this is t two then the time for processing t threeand finally that response will be sent back right so t four so the response will be sentback for may be activation or something like thatso this basically becomes t one plus t two plus t three plus t four so these this isthe total time that it takes until when the receiving device gets a signal about whatto do and by such a time in most of the real life applications of iot by this kind of timethe you know most of the ah you know ah the events most of the the unwanted events wouldtake place for example if it is a surveillance application maybe the intruder by this timebecause there is so much of latency that is involved by this time the intruder might havealready intruded into the territory or if it is ah a medical emergency scenario by thiskind of time the time it takes to send it to the cloud cloud processing at getting aresponse back etcetera etcetera so even the real timeliness is going to be lost and byah by ah because of this particular ah issue what is going to happen is if it is medicalemergency situation the patient might die rightso what is required is can we reduce the latency can we reduce the latency and this what weare trying to do in fog computing so as i said that fog was basically proposed by ahcisco and ah the whole idea is can we bring the cloud facilities the attractiveness ofcloud closer to the iot device layer and ah the whole idea is to solve the problems thatare faced by cloud computing ah for use of iot ah for data processing so this is thewhole ah ah objective of ah fog computing and the whole idea is also to reduce the delayah that is incurred ah ah in sending the data from the sensor device to the cloud from thecloud getting a response back and activating the particular device so can we reduce thisparticular timeso this is the whole idea the whole premise under which the fog computing works so conceptuallywhat we have we use to have in ah ah iot and cloud ah you know this is the device layerwhere the all these iot devices the physical devices operate this is the cloud where allthe data are sent for processing and storage so what fog is saying is it is going to besort of like a middleware or a middle layer rather ah where ah some of the computationsome of the processing some of the storage at least transient storage is going to happenbefore the data that is sensed by these devices are sent to the cloud before it is sent tothe cloud can we do some intermediate processing intermediate storage for you know quickerdecision making this is the whole idea behind the use of ah ah a fog computingso let us go back to some statistics some of which we ah you know we also went thoroughah at the beginning of the course so we know that ah now it is because of all this differentsensors etcetera etcetera there is lot of data that is floating all around so it isestimated that by round twenty twenty forty percent of the worlds data will come fromsensors and ninety percent of the worlds data will be generated only during the period oflast two years ok so ninety percent of worlds data was generated only during the periodof last two yearsso ah you know it is also estimated that ah every day about two point five quintillionbytes of data is produced and the total expenditure on iot devices will be about one point seventrillion dollars by twenty twenty so given all these different statistics we now haveto think about an architecture of internet of things where in we can use this all thisdifferent devices in a scalable manner such that the processing happens with large numberof devices in a quicker manner and ah quicker and in an efficient manner the total numberof connected devices sorry the total number of connected vehicles worldwide will be abouttwo fifty million by twenty twenty as per estimates and there will be more than thirtybillion iot devices again as per estimateso the amount of data that is going to be generated by these iot devices is obviouslyquite huge so how do we handle this kind of huge ah ah data ah i mean one way is basicallyto use all these big data analytics and so on but ah even before that can we deduce theprocessing time of these data can we do something from the network point of view and that iswhere we have to take help of fog so why do we need fog computing because cloud has certaindeficiencies you know it is insufficient to handle the requirements of iot so there areissues with volume of data that is produced by by the iot devices the latency that meansthe time that it takes for a sensed data to go to the cloud and then come back that durationis the latency and the bandwidth bandwidth means that ah how much ah ah you know howmuch data is going to i mean ah how much ah ah the channel ah is going to be occupiedah ah because of this communication of all these data from the iot devicesso the fog computing architecture looks like this so we have all these iot devices we haveall these iot devices and we have the cloud so as i said traditionally we have to usethis iot devices to sense the physical phenomena occurring around them send the data to thecloud and get a get an action or comment back so as we can see over here that this is thetraditional cloud model and so why we need fog computing because we want to reduce thisparticular time and typically this cloud servers might be physically located even continentsaway means you know it is typical to have them ah in different cities and so on buteven continent away also so this physical limitation also introduces large latency incommunicationso in terms of the data volume it is estimated that by twenty twenty about fifty billiondevices will be online and presently billions of devices produce exabytes of data everyday and this is this big data right so so me so much of data is going to a producedevery day not only every day every second every minute so much of data unusual volumesof data are going to be produced because of the introduction of internet of things exabyteexabyte means what ten to the power eighteen so you know we have ah giga byte tera bytebeta byte gita byte exabyte right so typically we use to use traditionally with giga bytesup data maximum but now it is with ah you know internet of things and so on it is verycommon to have tera bytes gita bytes exabytes of data ah that is produced every day andto be to to to handle this kind of data volume so the device density is also increasing everyday so the current cloud model is enable to process these amount of dataso the private firms factories aeroplane companies they all produce huge volumes data every dayso if you look at this particular figure this will be clear so we are not talking aboutdata produced by a single firm we are talking about data that is produced by several severalfirms ah you know ah and ah the different devices that are used in those firms the iotdevices the embedded systems devices that are basically used in those firms severalyou know huge volumes of data are produced every day by a single firm and definitelylarge number of firms also produce large volumes of data factories the same kind of thing factoriesalso produced large volumes of data aero plane companies airplanes themselves have lot ofdifferent types of sensors they also produce large number of large volumes of data so allthese data would have to be sent to the cloud for further storage and processingso the current cloud model that we have already gone through in the previous lectures on cloudcomputing cannot basically store all these data so this data that is produced the rawform of data has to be filtered before ah the data is sent to the cloud so this hasto be preprocessed filtered before it is destined for storage and processing in the cloud interms of latency lot of time being taken by a data packet for a round trip and this iswhat i was explaining to you with the diagram that i showed at the outset so an importantaspect for handling ah ah time sensitive data is basically to handle this issue of latencybecause if it is time sensitive it is real time data so time is important and that isthe reason why latency has to be handled with special interest if the age devices sent timesensitive data to the cloud for analysis and wait for the cloud to give a prospered actionthen it can be it can lead to many wanted results so file handling time sensitive dataa million second can make a huge differenceso look at this particular figure over here so ambulances ah then ah different ah buildingsand ah different other ah ah you know different other ah ah devices and so on cars ah andso on so they they basically generate data which are time sensitivity in nature so theybasically generate it of which are time sensitive in nature and ah ah so that is the reasonwhy they have to be processed pretty fast to be able to use the data in a meaning fullmannerso they have to be paid processing pretty fast so ambulance for example will ah ah ahgenerate ah some data so the time that it takes the data ah ah for the data to ah ahgo from here to the cloud and come back this can be represented with this ah you know thiscan be shown ah in the form of this kind of equation so latency equal to the time it takesah ah for the data to go from the device that means the iot device to the cloud plus thetime for data analysis plus the time it takes for the data to travel from the cloud to thedevice so latency will be increased and from the action reaches the device accident mayhave already occurred if it is an emergency situation or a connected vehicle situationso this is the reason why fog computing is very important so in terms of the bandwidththe bit rate of the data sorry in terms of the bandwidth bandwidth is calculated as thebit rate of data during transmission so if all the data are generated by iot devicesand those data that are generated by these devices are sent to the cloud for storageand analysis then the traffic generated by these devices will be simply giganticso these iot devices are going to consume almost all the bandwidth because of this andhandling this kind of traffic will be simply a very hard task so billions of devices consumingbandwidth if all the devices become online even ipv six or ip based technologies willnot be able to handle ah the facility to all the ah to provide the facility to all thedevices and the data may be may be confidential which the firms do not want to share onlineso this is these are the different problems one is the the the privacy of the data thisis of concern to the firms the second is that ah you know dealing with ah these kind ofproblems with ip based technologies like ipv six is a problem and also the issue of havingbillions of devices consuming bandwidthso you know how do we handle them together in a synergistic manner reduced latency ofdata appropriate action at the time right time prevents major accidents such as machinefailure and so on so a minute delay while taking an action makes a huge difference andthis is what i was explaining to you during the medical emergency scenario a person mightdie a person might completely die if you know the decision making takes lot of lot of timecompared to the time for sensingso it has to be the time for decision making that means processing storage etcetera shouldbe conformant with the time for sensing so the time it takes for sense is almost aftersomething is sensed immediately thereafter it has to be disseminated and correspondingaction also has to be taken in real time data security iot data must be secured and protectedfrom the intruders data required to be monitored twenty four seven an appropriate action shouldbe taken before the attack causes major harm to the network and this is what i was explainingto you and the operationals reliability the data that is generated from the iot devicesare used to solve real time problems the problems of integrity and availability of data mustbe ah guaranteed and unavailability and tampering of the data can be hazardous processing ofdata at the respective ah suitable places data can be divided into three types basedon the sensitivity one is time sensitive data second is the less time sensitive data andthird is data which are not time sensitive at all so this kind of filtering has to happenah with respect to the sensitivity of data so extremely time sensitive data should beanalyzed very near to the ah to the data source and data of which are not time sensitive willbe analyzed in the cloudso time sensitive data closer to the devices non time sensitive data send it to the cloudmonitor data across large geographical areas the location of the connected iot devicescan be spread across a large geographical area example the monitoring the railway trackof a country or a state the devices are exposed to the harsh environmental conditions additionallyas well so when should we use fog if the data should be analyzed within a fraction a minutefraction of a second if there is huge number of devices in the network if the devices areseparated by large geographical distance or if the devices are needed to be subjectedto extreme conditions so with this we come to an end of first part of lecture on fogcomputing in this lecture we have understood what fog is the genesis of fog computing andalso about how fog computing can help in building internet of things systems we have also inthe process gone through some limitations of the use of iot
