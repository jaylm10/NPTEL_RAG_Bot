so the next lecture on the series on cloud computing for internet of things is on theservice models so we we briefly in the previous lecture have gone through the different typesof service models we have seen that there are three core service models that have beenpopular since the inception of cloud computing ah the first one is software as a servicethe second one is platform as a service and the third one is infrastructure as a serviceso let us try to go through the details further of each of these clouds cloud models so aswe can see over here we have these different applications which have to be served and forservice serving these applications we need to take help of the software resources theplatform and the infrastructure so what we have we have software as a servicewe have platform as a service and we have the infrastructure as a service so infrastructureis surface on top of virtual machines virtual storage and virtual grid so we have this infrastructureas a surface made available and then we have the platform is a service which includes securityidentification integration workflow application grid user interface services database gridand so on and then we have this software as a service which we serving different applicationsas well in fact all these service models are serving different applications are servingdifferent customers and so on and then we have these administrative services which arein addition so these administrative services include thingslike packaging configuration deployments scaling lifecycle management utilization user managementand so on so when we compare that the these three service models the serve the softwareas a service the platform as a service and the infrastructure as a service with respectto the traditional computing ah ah computing paradigm then we see we observe a few thingsso whereas traditionally starting from applications data runtime middleware operating system virtualizationservice offerings storage networking all these things would have to be done by the user himselfin the case of infrastructure as a service concerns about or issues of applications dataruntime middleware and operating system are done at the user end whereas virtualizationserver storage networking are taken care of by the service providerso as you can see over here in this model the operating system is at the user end inthe platform as a service as we can see compared to infrastructure as a service where the oswas as part of the user here only two things applications and data are taken care of bythe user the rest of the other things are taken care of by the service provider endand in software as a service everything is taken care of by the service provider so thisis a side by side comparison between infrastructure as a service platform as a service softwareas a service and the traditional computing methodology so we start with each of theseservice models and try to understand what is inside so as per the definition of amazoninfrastructure as a service which is appreciated as iaas contains the basic building blocksfor cloud it and typical typically provide access to networking features computerswhich are virtual or dedicated hardware and data storage space so we have this computinginfrastructure which has to be made available on demand to the different users through somekind of virtualization mechanism so infrastructure as a service provides the following featuresit has servers for computation and ah the different machines are also made availablelike different workstations etcetera so so servers and machines then we have the storagewe have network we have the operating system the working methodology is like this we havea physical server and then we have this virtualized server the users rent the servers the softwareand the data center space or network equipment the cloud service provider offers the resourcemanagement and the outsourced service on demand is made available for use so this is the physicalserver here we have the hardware on top of ah that on top of hardware we have the osand the apps and in comparison in the virtualized server we have hardware as before then wehave some virtual machines so these virtual machines vm one and vm two would include theoperating system and the application layers so we have on top of the hardware multiplevirtual machines executing and there is the concept of hypervisor which basically managesthis show by sitting between the hardware layer and the vm layer so the vm layer basicallycontains the vms the hardware layer the actual physical hardware and the hypervisor is sortof playing some kind of a managerial role in between these two so why do we need infrastructureas a service so basically new businesses can kick start without basically having to investon vine computing hardware and this is a scalable model by which rapidly whenever the businessesneed some resources they can subscribe pay for and start using the resources and wheneverthey do not required they will not waste the resources and will stop utilizing themso it is suitable for serving fluctuating computing demands example flipkart amazonetcetera during festive seasons you know they need more infrastructure during festive seasonsbecause of the obvious you know obviousness due to the the ah upsearch in the businessso you know but at the other times of the year they do not need this so as you can seethat there is fluctuating computing demand and whenever required you use those resourceswhenever not required you release the resources and so on so it is suitable for new businessmodel trials it helps in minimizing the capital expenses scalability issue and elasticitydynamic scaling of required infrastructure resources is made possible through infrastructureservice having large amount of resource allocation or release in a short span of time is possiblein the infrastructure as a service model and there is no variation in system performancewhile scaling up or down manageability and inter probability clients in this particularmodel have total control of the virtualized infrastructure resources they can do whateverthey want with the resources that are offered to themso they can preconfigured they can preconfigured the facility for the allocation or can virtualizethe resources and these virtualized resources are to be monitored for their running statusthe overall health and so on and the usage and the billing system records the use ofthe infrastructure resources and accordingly calculates the payment availability and reliabilityso storing of the data and the retrieval of the stored data can be made possible at anytime without any failure of any any any kind whatsoever whatsoever be the failure so itis not possible you know the resources can be made available reliably and be made availableat anytime anywhere the clients should be able to access the computational resourceswithout failure and there should be uninterrupted facility for computation and communicationin terms of performance and optimization high utilization of physical resources among thedifferent clients is possible through the use of the infrastructure as a service modelit is also possible to enable high computing power with the large pool of physical resourcesusing parallel processing and it is also possible to optimize the ah ah ah the deployment ofphysical resources by dynamically configuring the virtual infrastructure resources in termsof accessibility and portability this basically provides the facility for client to ah toease ease out various tasks with respect to control management access [infra/infrastructure]infrastructure access and so on and to facilitate the easy reallocation and duplication of theallocated infrastructure resources iaas can be obtained as a pub public cloud a privatecloud and the hybrid cloud and each of these we have already discussed in the fundamentalslecture on cloud computing for iot so the challenges and limitations of infrastructureas a service includes that there is sometimes in certain places regulatory approval thatis required for the use of outsourcing outsourced storage and outsourced processing throughthe cloud model and network latency may degrade the level of expected performance as wellusers may require automated decision making of job scheduling to available resources andseamless scaling of service services independent of traffic variation and developers have tofocus on low level system details these are some of these limitations of infrastructureas a service next comes the platform as a service so herei will read out the definition for you platform is a service removes the need for organizationsto manage the underlying infrastructure which is usually a hardware and operating systemcombination and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applicationso as you can understand application development firms would be strongly benefited throughthe use of platform as a service so platform as a service provides the platform which allowsthe developers to create applications which can be offered as services via the internetit basically makes the applications ah you know easy to develop it simplifies the applicationdevelopment and deploy and and deployment by providing the cloud aware features platformas a service is an application middleware which is offered as a service to the developersit provides the abstraction and security for the developed applications it facilitatesthe development and management applications without the complexity of maintaining theunderlying infrastructure it allows customers to rent virtualized these servers and theassociated services and provides elastic scaling of the users deployed application there aredifferent features of platform as a service in terms of operating system ah you know operatingsystem can be made available through the platform as a service based on the choice of the inthe developers or the users server side scripting is possible database management is possibleserver software support net storage network access offering different tools for designand development of software and hosting these are all made available as different featuresof platform as a service the working model is like this that it allows the users to createthe software applications using offer tools and it provides the p configured featuresthat the customers can subscribe it supports the available ah it support ah supports availabilityand management of the infrastructure and applications for customers and the services are regularlyupdated with new features the business advantages are with respect tothe middleware service support the development and deployment tools the easy access to themand also the freedom for managing development and deployment tools individually and finallythe software is a service again the amazon definition i will read out software is a serviceprovides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service providerin most cases people referring to software as a service are referring to end user applicationsso saas is a simplified model of software develop delivery or over the internet it typicallyuses web browser working as a thin client and supports a fully pay as you go model italso has some additional features for example remote access of software is possible viathe internet where the web browser acts as a thin client ah it also has facilities foraccess and control of commercial software via the internet and also this multi tenancyapplication delivery to multiple people at the same time multiple tenants at the sametime in one to many model is made possible through software as a service compared tothe traditional software the comparison with software as a service is given in this particulartable the advantages include for example with respect to traditional software customershave to traditionally install manage and maintain the the application the software whereas insoftware as a service the customers simply use all these over the internet the traditionalsoftware runs on individual organization on dedicated instantiation whereas software asa service runs on multiple ah customers simultaneously clock sorry cross platform support is requiredin traditional software whereas in software service there is no concernfor cross platform support like this there are different other advantages of softwareas a service over the traditional software scalability is ah to maximize the applicationconcurrency to optimize the share resource share resource pool such as threads and networkconnections multi tenancy its an important architectural shift from designing isolatedsingle tenant applications to supporting multiple tenant applications it has the ability toaccommodate users from multiple companies at the same time and there is transparencythat is improved by the use of this model amongst all the users in terms of configurabilityit is about to facilitate it it facilitates well allocation of single application on asingle server to several users to customize the application for one customerwhile changing the application for other customers as well the the limitations of saas includesupporting centralized control so that is not a very good thing it is a limitation switchingthe cost so switching cost rather switching cost between different software limited flexibilityit has immediate flexibility and there are data security and privacy concerns in thismodel so these are the three main models of cloud the software as a service platform asa service and infrastructure as a service and we have gone through the different advantagesand limitations of each of these models and as we will see later on that these modelscoupled with few other concepts are required in order to meaningfully develop and deployiot services maybe for smartphone applications or maybe for smart ah cities applicationsthank you
