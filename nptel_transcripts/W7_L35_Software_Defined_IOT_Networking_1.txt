having understood software defined networking basic concepts through the previous two lectureswe are now going to see how sdn can be used in the context of internet of things the themeof this particular course and as we will see that there is lot of opportunity and lot ofproblems number of problems that are facing internet of things can be addressed with thehelp of iot ah with the help of sdn technology so let us look at how sdn can be applied inmaking for making iot efficient so if we look at the iot architecture we have already seenthe iot architecture in different ways in the previous lectures so let us now look atfrom a different perspective so what we have as we can see here is the different layersin the reference model this is the this is taken from the wall forum reference modeland we have different layers for example the physical devices and controllers connectivityage computing data accumulation data abstraction application collaboration and processes andthe right hand side figure shows a different view of iot all together from a differentviewpoint how iot works so we have this tiered segmentation of theiot networks we have the context aware tier we have the network tier and we have the applicationtier and these different modules corresponding to each of these tiers are all given overhere without so it is not required for us to understand each of these in further detailand with this particular background of iot let us now move ahead and see how sdn canbenefit iot so you know the integration of sdn to iot so by doing integration of sdnto iot one very important fundamental problem that can be solved is one can have intelligentrouting decision making to be done to implement it in an sdn implemented iot networkthe second thing is the information collection analysis decision making all of these canbe simplified through the integration of sdm in iot third is the visibility of networkresources network management is simplified based on the user device the application specificrequirements so this visibility of network resources and the simplification with respectto these criteria these aspects they can be done with the help of indication of sdn iniot and the last one is intelligent traffic pattern analysis and coordinated decisionsand i dont need to elaborate further on this because this is quite self explanatory intelligenttraffic pattern analysis and coordinated decision making through the controller right so wealready know what what a controller means and what it does so all these things can bedone with the help of sdn so what is very important is intelligence you know more intelligenceis proved into the network and improving the efficiency of the network with the help ofthe sdn technology so iot can also benefit from these advantagesnow if we look at this particular figure in front of us we have these different devicesthe iot devices in different sub networks maybe and these devices through mobile axisor fixed axis channels this data from these devices they can be acquired and be transmittedto the data aggregator here all these data aggregation are going to be done of the datathat is received from these different iot devices and then it passes through a transportnetwork and from the transport network it goes to the different gateways and the packetsegregation is going to be done using this so this is basically the simplified view ofan iot network now what happens is when we want to integrate sdn what we are trying todo is we are going to use the sdn controller so what the sdn controller is going to dois it is going to control each of these different things different aspects and also it is youknow it is going to improve the orchestration between the different devices between thedifferent protocols that are running etcetera etcetera in this network and overall it isgoing to improve the service logic that is behind it so this is going to be improvednow with the sdn with the implementation of the sdn the control of these n devices iotdevices which includes sensors actuators rf id tags and any other iot device so you knowthe centralized control is made possible then here as we can see this part can take careof the rule placement because we have these access devices over here the rule placementwhile considering issues like mobility etcetera and the heterogeneity of the n devices thiscan be implemented here and the rule placement and traffic engineering and backbone networkscan be taken care of at the transport network and flow classification and enhanced securityare taken care of at the data center networks so let us switch back our gear and let uslook at one of the fundamental building blocks of iot which is the sensor network so oneof the challenge is in behind the working of the sensor network is real time programmingof each of these sensor nodes is typically not feasible not at all feasible you knowyou cannot go and you know program the sensor nodes as such you know it is possible to programthe sensor nodes but you know real time programming of these sensor nodes is not possible thenthese sensor nodes and these corresponding networks they have they follow vendor specificarchitecture each of these nodes that are made by different vendors they have theirown different architectures different layers implemented in them there is no one standardso no the each of them they implement their own vendor specific architecture these nodesare resource constrained so you know the heavy computations that are often required cannotbe performed at each of these nodes and additionally there is the resource limitation with respectto memory there is limited memory so we cannot insert too many control programs in this networksso these challenges basically also gives us opportunities opportunities like can we programthe sensor nodes in real time can we change the forwarding path in real time can we integratethe different sensor nodes in a sensor network so we have different solutions that have beenproposed to take care of these challenges and opportunities that exist one of the recentworks relatively recent works which was published in the i triply communication letters in twothousand twelve is the sensor openflow protocol so the sensor openflow protocol takes careof forwarding in two different ways one is the value centric data forwarding the otherone is the id centric data forwarding value centric for example if the sensor data exceedsa certain threshold value then the data is going to be forwarded other way the otherway round is to adopt the id centric data forwarding for example the data will be forwardedbased on the id of the source node if it is coming from a particular source node withcertain id then it is going to be forwarded otherwise notso real life implementation of such a method is not yet available this is one of the limitationsof this particular solutions bera et al that means in our group this one group we haveproposed the soft wsn protocol and it was published in the i triple e systems journalin two thousand sixteen here we have adopted different component solutions so we have thesensor device management which comprises of sensor management delay management and activesleep management i am not going to go through these in detail but it is available and thereis available for you in the slide and for further details it is there in the paper itriple e systems journal paper so this is one major component the sensordevice management and the other one is the topology management so topology managementbasically you know takes care of node specific management for forwarding of the data fromtheir specific nodes and we have what we have done compared to the previous low it elseah paper it else work which was published in high triply communication letters in twothousand sixteen here we have performed experimental results you know here we have performed reallyreal life experimentation so we have in this paper we have shown experimental results thatshow that the network performance can be improved using software defined wsn over traditionalwsm so i will just present very briefly some ofthe results i have taken from that particular paper for example with respect to the packetdelivery ratio so this is the packet delivery ratio using soft wsn that means the proposedsolution and and the regular wsn where no no protocol is implemented so its a pairedpone ah basic protocol that exists so here that is the reason actually we have observedand that we are able to see much improved packet delivery ratio much improved packetdelivery ratio using soft wsn so what we see is the packet delivery ratio in the networkincreases using soft wsn compared to the traditional wsm here this plot shows the number of datapackets that are forwarded and as we can see over here the soft wsn the number of datapackets that are forwarded is much less compared to the number of ah packets in ah in a regularwsn so the data packet means the replicated datapackets so i i i should mention this over here the number of replicated data packetsso replicated data packets not the number of regular data packets but the replicateddata means the this soft wsn basically reduces the number of replications of data packetsover the traditional wsn the third result basically shows the number of control packetsthat are forwarded the number of control packets in the network is higher using this proposedprotocol the soft wsn protocol that means our protocol over the traditional wsn thisis due to that the packet in messages in the network are less each time a node receivesa new packet it asks the controller for getting adequate forwarding logic and that is whythe number of control messages in the network gets reducedthe other solution which ah has integrated sdn into sensor networks is the sdn wise andit was published in the i triple e infocom conference in two thousand fifteen so hereits a sdn you know software defined some wsn platform sdn why is basically proposes a softwaredefined wsn sensor network platform where the flow table for rule placement is ah isavailable at the sensor nodes it was designed how the flow table is going to look like andany programming language can be used through api to program the nodes in real time in sdnwise very briefly i want to show you the schematic of how sda sdn wise works i do not want toah you know discuss this solution in detail but i just wanted to show you the overallarchitecture of sdn wise so what we have are the sensor nodes we have the sink and we havethe emulated nodes and so as we can see over here we have in the sink we have the realsink and their simulated sink and this is the you know these are the different layersthe forwarding layer over here and the different other regular layers and how they talk toeach other so this part is the emulated part and this part is the real part and this onethe sink basically has to both the components the real sink as well as the simulated sinkso these sensor nodes basically they have they run the eight zero two point fifteenpoint four protocol in their work stn wise there is a microcontroller unit and thereis a eight zero two point fifteen point four stack on top of which sdn wise basically functionsright and then we have the inpp which is the in network packet progressing processing layerso in summary we have looked at how sdn is useful to manage and control the iot networkwireless sensor nodes and network can be controlled using sdn based applications network performancecan be improved significantly using sdn based approaches over the traditional sensor networkapproaches and we have also seen that there are different protocols the latest one thatwe have seen is the sdn wise we have also looked at the soft wsn protocol that was infact proposed by us and we had experimented with real hardware real iot hardware realsensor network hardware and before that there is there was another solution that was proposedby low et l and was published in ah the i triple e communication letters in two thousandtwelve so basically these are the three main protocols that are available currently thereare ah few other solutions also that might that are also available but these are theprominent ones ah and so this is basically the state of the art with respect to the implementationof ah sdn for ah sensor network in the next part of the lecture ah we are going to talkabout how iot devices like mobile devices can exploit the use of sdn to make them efficientwith this we come to an end
