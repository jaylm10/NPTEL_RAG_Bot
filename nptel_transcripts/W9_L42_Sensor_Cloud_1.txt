in this lecture we ae going to get introduced to a very fine technology the sensor cloudtechnology which is become popular in the last few years its popular particularly foriot environments for the development of iot environments so sensor cloud sensor cloudas the name suggests is about integration of two technologies sensor rather sensor networksand cloud technology so the whole idea is through the integration of sensor technologyor sensor network technology with cloud can we offer sensors or sensing as a service inthe same way as in the traditional cloud computing platform which we have gone through in otherlecture so in cloud computing people are talking aboutoffering computing facilities as a service infrastructure computing infrastructure asa service software as a service platform as a service and so on so this is what we havegone through in the during the cloud computing ah lecture so here in censor cloud we aretalking about can we have a model where sensors or sense data or sensing can be offered toend users as a service a very fine technology a very nice idea that can basically revolutionizethe way we look at iot today so us let us look at it further so in sensornetworks we are primarily concerned about sensing of a particular region where the sensorsare deployed in cloud computing we are primarily talking about storage of the data processingof the data and so on how ever when we talk about sensors and cloud together we are talkingabout how we can basically integrate the benefits that are obtained from each of these two technologiesbut those benefits are not nearly about getting the sense data to the cloud dumping the sensedata to the cloud or its not about the simple virtualization of the sensors the way we haveseen that computing platforms are virtualized in cloud so here also it is not a very simpleintegration of sensors and cloud computing technologies so it is not a mere integrationof sensors and cloud computing technology and also at the same time so it is neitherthe integration and at the same time it is nor the dumping of the sense data to the cloudneither of these two so we can think of it as both of these plussome additional additional attributes neither of these alone both of these together plusseveral several other benefits that we can get out of this integration so just a quickrecap of sensor networks we have already gone through it in detail so in a sensor networkwhat we have we have the sensor noses sensing the physical phenomena that are occurringin the environment of their operation these nodes send the data the sense data to thesink which is a centralized unit and the communication between the sink and the other sensor nodesin the network is typically multi hop which can also be single hop if the sensor nodethat means the source node and the sink are sufficiently close to each other and the sinknode basically either processes the data itself further or it sends it to a server for furtherprocessing so this is what additional sensor networks doesso in a traditional sensor network we are typically talking about such a scenario wehave the sensor nodes connected to the sink sensor nodes sensing the data sending thedata to the sink the sense data to the sink so we have in every sensor node a sensingunit a processing unit and a communication unit sensing unit will have to sense whatis going on around it processing unit will do some processing you know some basic processingand the communication unit will send it forward to the next top neighbor for final deliveryto the sink the different applications of it sensor networks we have already gone throughagain target tracking wild life monitoring health care industrial applications smarthomes smart city agriculture vehicular networks that means connected vehicles and so manyso many different types of applications of sensor networks cloudlet us have a brief recap cloud basically provides an architecture some computationalplatform which can be used on demand to get access to computational resources wheneverrequired that means on demand on a pay per use basis so the advantages of cloud technologyover the traditional server based technologies like server farms etcetera one is elasticitythat means we can very easily scale up or down as per the requirements if the if thereis increase in the requirement of a in the requirement of computational resources thenit you know without actually going about buying those additional resources one can simplysubscribe and pay for those resources and start using them right through the click ofa mouse button self service the resources can be accessedby this by self that means the you know the resources can be accessed by themselves youknow the resources can be accessed by themselves and ah themselves means the the the the thesensor nodes ah or the computing computational nodes and ah so we are talking about ah threeah types of ah a typically or traditionally three types of cloud computing services infrastructureas a service iaas platform as a service eaas and software as a service is saasand differentcloud clients like different apps web browsers terminals etcetera are going to get accessto the data and the services from the cloud so what are the services saas paas and iaasand i do ah i know i will just give you some example once again we have already gone throughit and i will skip it ah i will not skip but i will go through pretty fast so softwareas a service a good example is microsoft office three sixty five platform as a service examplewindows azure infrastructure as a service you know several examples of inclusion ofstorage spaces computational ah resources and so onnow let us come to the concept of virtualization which is key to cloud and sensor cloud sovirtualization through the virtualization concept physically one computer might be holdingon to the resources and to many computers those resources can be shared they can usethose other computers can use those resources can get access to the resources as and whenrequired so overall the through put and costs are going to be increased and ah the benefitis that virtualization basically permits or enables this sharing of the resources whichmeans that the same resource can be shared in by in turn through the reduction of thecost encapsulation which is that virtualizationtechnology basically provides a one stop solution a complete solution giving a complete computingenvironment independence basically means that it runs independent that means virtual terminalruns independent of the underline hardware and this virtual terminals are portable thatmeans that a user might be using the computational resources through a virtual ah terminal andah and that resource where it is not used those resources map to the actual physicalresources those physical resources can be made available to another user the limitationsof networks so what we are talking about is the overall price of procurement is quitehigh so if we have some sensing needs so the only way to go about you know full fillingthose needs is to buy from the market sensors sensor notes and sensor networks and thengo about deploying then the question is that we also have tobe careful about we are we want to procure form from and the types of sensors that areintegrated to the platform so this is one limitation second limitation is about deploymentso what is required is to have the right way of deployment and the right place of deploymentright way means the the how how it is going to be deployed and where it is going to bedeployed and in terms of maintenance most the deployment maintenance and battery lifetime are other limitations of sensor networks so from an applications perspective againwhat we see is when the application changes the requirement also change however as wewill see that the sensor cloud technology can come to a rescue at least partially throughthe introduction of sensor cloud not only the mere integration ah so sensor cloud isnot only the mere integration of cloud computing and sensor networks but it is also about payper use facility offering pay per use facility using the concepts of virtualization of thesensor node and introducing a layer between sensor node and the end userso here is a side by side comparison of traditional sensor networks with sensor cloud so typicallyin a in the traditional sensor networks we are talking about single user in sensor cloudthe benefits would be experienced more when we are talking about multiple users then insensor networks the data are aggregated and send to the sensor network user and in sensorcloud the infrastructure basically takes care of it the sensor cloud infrastructure basicallyis tasked to aggregate and send it forward and at the device level these devices arededicated to a single user in sensor networks and this can be improved by serving multipleapplications by the different sensors so these are the different advantages of sensor cloudover sensor networks now in sensor cloud we are talking about nota single user or a single actor or a single role but we are talking about different typesof roles different types of actors we are talking about sensor owners who basicallyown the sensor we are talking about scsp sensor cloud service provider who is who may notbe the owner but is separate from the owner and is simply the ah the the ah the ah youknow the service provider sensor cloud service provider the sensing service provider andwhen we have this maintenance with respect to maintenance again the service providerdoes it overhead and usage and so we see that we have diverse types of sensor cloud we havedivert types diverse diverse types of sensor cloud actors and in the traditional sensornetwork we use to have only a single type of actor which is the wsn userso we have end users we have sensor owner and the sensor cloud service provider threedifferent types of three different types of actors we additionally have end users andscsp which is basically the sensor cloud service provider which primarily takes the managerialrole so we see in this particular figure we have a state of sensor owners then we havethrough virtualization pricing caching composition management we take care of servicing the requestfrom the scsp and also sending the responses back and finally the vertical ah communicationover here with the weight portal so the left hand side figure basically showsthat how the sensor cloud data is accessed through a browser interface so we have a browserinterface and the template as well as the sensed data are sent to the user organizationand this data from the user organization are basically fade as data feeds to diverse applicationson the other hand on the right hand side figure we see a the real view of sensor cloud sohere we see that there are only a few functionalities scaling dynamic scaling then on demand physicalsensor scheduling energy management quality of service an application specific real timedata aggregation so here is the flow diagram the sequence diagramof sensor cloud so as we can see over here the different actors or roles include userorganization sensor ml interpreter virtual sensor manager virtual sensor controller andresource manager so initially from the user organization a operations request is sentto the sensor ml interpreter this creates the virtual instance of the sensor then thisis basically sent to manage the controller to basically a function on the controllera response is received from the controller the response is again transmitted forwardfurther and then this xml template is decoded like this this continues the data are storedin the sensor resource pool and different functionalities such as service sensor ahphysical sensor definition virtual sensor group definition client information metadataand templates are used over here in this architecture let us now briefly consider a case study sowe considered a sensor network based target tracking application in which a sensor networkowner refuses to share the shared the sensed information with an external body even inexchange of money consequently any organization that which is to detect the intrusion within a particular zone has to deploy its own senor network this leads to the long terminvestment due to costly network setup and maintenance overheads however in a sensorcloud environment the same organization can use the same written application and stillget the service without actually owning the sensors so this is the whole advantage youdo not you know we we ah the users have sensing needs but they do not have to really own thesensors in order to get access to the sensed information about the physical environmentof operation so with this we come to an end of the firstpart of the lecture on sensor cloud the next lecture is going to be on the more advancedtopics of sensor cloud and that we are ah ah you know so there we are going to learnabout the different solutions as well about how to handle different solutions in sensorcloud thank you
