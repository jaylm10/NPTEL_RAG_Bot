so the first lecture is going to be on the basics of internet of things so in this lecturewe are going to get introduced to the different fundamental concepts behind iot and the basictechnologies connectivity devices that are required and an overall understanding abouthow iot is are made so we are going to have in this lecture and understanding about allof these concepts but first let us get motivated about why iot is requiredso it has been anticipated that very soon all the different things that are going thatwe are seeing around us and that we have around us are all going to be internet worked theyare all going to be interconnected so at present what we enjoy as services as internet basedservices is basically a connection of different computers and computing devices so basicallythis capital i internet that all of us we use is basically a global network or an internetwork of different computers and computing devicesnow what internet of things says is that the scope of this internet is going to be expandedso it is going to be expanded beyond computing and computer devices being connected it isgoing to interconnect different things that physical objects that we see around us thedifferent objects such as the lighting system in a room the lights the fans the air conditionersand anything and everything including things such as the toothbrush the microwave oventhe refrigerator and so on and so forth and not only in our homes but also in our businessessuch as internet working different machines internet working ah different equipments andso on so each and everything that we see around us that we use at our home in businesses inworkplaces everything being internetworked so this is the whole vision of internetworkof things internet of thingsnow there are several challenges that are going to arise if we want to do it but beforethat it is also discuss about why it is going to be required why internet of things hasbecome so popular why it is going to be required it is the reason is that iot is envisagedto be able to provide advanced level of service to the society to the business and so on soadvanced levels of services can be offered with the help of iot based technologyso what is going to happen is these different things the chairs the tables these lightingsystem the you know the watch ah ah anything and everything that you can think of all ofthese are going to be fitted with embedded systems embedded electronics and informationtechnology so that they have some basic computing platform in them attached to them and in andthen they are going to be acting as different nodes of that particular internet the iotinternet of things rightso what is going to happen is these systems these things are going to be all equippedwith embedded systems and these embedded systems along with embedded electronics embedded processorembedded communication systems and so on so they are going to help in connecting the differentother things that are around them and depending on the application requirements dependingon the specific goals of the business and then a big internet is going to be formedwhich is much much bigger than the current internet of computers and that is the internetworkinternet of things iotnow iot is one of the building blocks that is considered to be of use for developingsmart homes and smart cities so at present not only in our country but throughout theworld there is a lot of interest on developing smart cities and smart homes so iot is oneof the enabling technologies to make the city smart to mix make the home smart so how itis going to be done that is going to be more evident as we proceed through the differentlectures and the different intricacies that are going to be there in building this complexinternet of things is going to be ah evident ah ah a through different lectures that weare going to go through in this particular courseso going forward internet technology that we have as i have already said it is goingto expand beyond the connection of simple computers so we are going to connect or internetworkdifferent machines different tools typically but not necessarily using wireless technologieswireless technologies such as wifi cellular technologies bluetooth zigbee and the differentother wireless technologies that are available to usnow in order to be able to do it what is going to happen is because the number of thingsis very large much larger than the number of computers that are available so it is goingto increase the number of nodes in this particular network so iot in other words is going tohave large number of nodes the iot internetwork is going to have large number of nodes eachnode corresponding to the different distinct objects or different things that exist inthe physical worldso the things basically are going to explode the number of connected things are going toexplode in time with with time so the things that are connected to the internet are goingto be projected to cross the twenty billion figure in the near future this is what hasbeen predicted so a large number of things billions and in fact billions and trillionsof things are going to be connected to the internetwork of thingsso at this point i should also mention one more thing that this internetwork of thingscan be construed to be built in two different ways one way is to expend the scope of thecurrent internet that means the internet of computers this is one way so you expand soso essentially what is going to happened using this particular approach is all these differentthings are going to be connected to the existing internetso this internet is going to be expanded further it is going to become much bigger than whatit is at present with only the computers connected this is the first approach the other approachis to build a separate internetwork of these physical objects from scratch so one is basicallyexpanding the existing internet the other one is a separate one a separate internetworkwhich is going to be built from scratch so irrespective of which one we adopt each ofthese approaches has its own separate challenges that have to be overcomeso going back we have the unification of different technologies that becomes very very much mandatorywe have so internetwork of things is not a single technology physical devices can beof different types different types of physical devices having ah different configurationsdifferent specifications and so on each of these supported through different other systemssuch as cloud technology big data machine learning networking computer vision you nameit and all these different ah ah technologies from electrical sciences and some from evenmechanical sciences are required in order to build iotso talking about the origin of iot so in the two thousand what we are going to witnessis a new era of ubiquity so in this era of ubiquity what is going to happen is not onlythat we are going to have anywhere any place that means any place any time connectivityor services relating to connectivity that means internet or network connectivity ofdifferent types but also the surface of connecting anything so anytime anyplace anything connectivityis what is going to be observed in the in this new era of ubiquity so that is goingto result in billions and trillions of things humans everybody being connected and consequentlywhat is going to happen is the number of humans that are on the earth that that is going tothis number this figure is going to be outnumbered very soon with the number of things that areconnected to the internetwork of things internet of thingsand consequently what is going to happen is all these different devices all these differentthings they are going to send lot of data this data has to be handled properly thisthis data have to be analyzed and this is what we are going to cover in one of the ahnext lectures and so what is going to happen is this internetwork the new internetworkthat we are talking about the internet of things is going to be a very complex networkwith much wider scope than the current internet and with many more complexities and this iscurrently the vision of internet of things and all these lectures that we are going togo through in this particular course all the other lectures that we are going to go throughthey are going to cover the different challenges and how there are different tools that areavailable in order to what are the different tools that are available in order to addressthese different challengesso we are going to go and we are going to get introduced to all these different challengesand the different tools that are available in this particular course we are going tomostly understand the different concepts that are behind them and typically because itsan introductory course we are not going to go through each of these different technologiesthat are available to us in too much of detail but at a level that will help us to understandthe basic concepts for that are required for designing internet of things so there aredifferent enabling technologies for internet of things rfid is one we you know at presentin the market places and different places in the society you know and wherever we gowe see that rfid technology being used rfid tags rfid readers are being used so rfidisrfid based devices are required for building internet of thingssensors is another one which is according to me one of the most important enabling deviceor enabling technology for building internet of things sensors and actuators sensors andactuators is what we are going to cover ah in one of the ah ah next lectures very shortlyand and the other things are different network ah networking ah ah devices different connectivitiesdifferent communication ah paradigms and so on so these are also required in order toconnect these different sensors rfids and different other physical devices that haveto be internetwork ah to form the iot and finally i would like to mention that at presentthere is lot of interest in the 
nanotechnology domain so people are talking about buildinginternet of nano things inter internet 
of nano sensors and so onso you know what is going to happen is there are going to be very small 
sized nanosiz[e]-nanointhe order in the in order of nano sized devices that are going to be used 
for different purposesfor example there could be these nano capsules which can be ah which can be consumed 
andfinally which are going to be excreted after they ah ah ah you know after they have performedtheir functions so these nano devices are going to be used they are going to be swallowedand consumed and then ah you know so once that is done in the form of capsules theyare going to ah ah be internetwork these different nano devices these nano capsules are goingto talk to each other so these nano devices nano communication devices are being conceptualizedat present people are thinking about building these nano devices that can be used to formthe internet of nano things so ah once we have this internet of nano things that thethe horizon of internet of things is going to be expanded much furtherso we already have seen that when we are talking about iot it is mostly about networking ofphysical objects and these physical objects are embedded with ah you know the differentembedded electronics that communicate and sense and interact with the internal statesor with the external environment in which they are operating so either they are interactingwith each other they change their different states or they are interacting with the interexternal environment in which they are operatingthere are different characteristics there are different characteristics of iot so firstof all this iot that we develop that has to be efficient it has to serve efficiently therequirements of the applications for which they are deployed they have to be scalablebecause we as we have already seen that in iot systems we are talking about large numberof things we are talking about not simply millions of things but in in several billionsand trillions we are talking about the scalability is a very important consideration is a veryimportant issue that has to be addressedso even if the number of sensors and the sensing devices iot devices are going to ah increasethe overall network performance should not be compromised so the you know this is challengein terms of the network so from a networking perspective its a challenge that has to beworked on there has to be unambiguous meaning and addressing architecture so this is veryimportant so all these different devices already we have witnessed that addressing in the ipvfour context in the regular existing internet context is a big issueso we are talking about naming and addressing different mechanisms of naming and addressingwith the help of ip technology dns etcetera etcetera we are already we have already ahseen that these can be used in order to ah you know address these problems of addressingand naming in the context of ah ah in the context of the present internet and now whenwe are expending this internet in this large scale so what is going to happen is we aregoing to run into a bigger problem with naming and addressingso we need a new mechanism for naming and addressing of the different nodes these physicalnodes the physical objects that are fitted with embedded systems so another thing isthat in terms of the resource requirements each of these nodes are typically very lowpower they have very low resources and they have to ah ah they have to be you know wheneverthey are not required they have to be put to the sleeping mode they have to go ah througha sleep cycleso that means whenever they are not being used they are not being active they have tobe put in a sleep state and whenever they it is required they have to be made activethese devices can be mobile they can move for example a smartwatch you know whoeveris wearing the smartwatch when they move this node also moves the smartwatch also movesso mobility like this becomes a very important problem in the context of iot networks mobilityof the devices and the mobility of the sub networks also is possibleso part of the network becomes mobile and in extreme cases even larger network can alsobecome mobile so ip based addressing may not be always very suitable ah in this sort ofscenario so what are the different alternatives there are different people different researchersglobally who are working on how iot technology how naming can be a different form of namingcan be ah ah can be designed in order to support ah this iot technology and intermittent connectivityis another characteristic that is typical of iot these devices they move they get thenetwork and the subnetworks get partitioned one device which is in ah ah connectivitywith another device at a later instant of time may not be connectedso this is another problem that has to be taken care of so for this for example thereis this ah opportunistic mobile networks ah which is a topic ah ah which can help in addressingthis particular problem this technology the waymond technology can help in addressingthis particular problem so opportunistic mobile networks are useful in order to address theproblems of intermittent connectivity between the different nodes in the networkin terms of application domains there are you know iot is attractive in different applicationsspheres application domains spheres for instance manufacturing and business healthcare retailsecurity and so on so in among all of these it is estimated that most of the market sharewith iot goes with the manufacturing at an business sector so forty point two percentsah percent approximatelynext is the healthcare third is the retail sector and fourth is the security so surveillancesafety surveillance and so on with the help of iot based systems so when we talk aboutbusiness and manufacturing we are talking about how to improve the overall supply chainwhat are the different equipments that have to be introduced and different sensors andactuators can be fitted to them the different robotic machinery can be used in order toimprove the business processessecond is the healthcare we are talking about portable healthcare monitoring telemedicinein a much more bigger way that means much remote areas can also be connected the differenthealthcare facilities hospitals nursing homes doctors nurses irrespective of where theyare they can still monitor the healthcare condition the health condition of the patientsah ah that they are ah treatingso portable health monitoring electronic recordkeeping is another so automatically because you knowin medical domain record keeping is a very important concern so ah electronic recordkeeping automatically things are the records medical records are going to be archived theyare going to be stored they are going to be you know so maybe they can be even furtheranalyzed to grow some meaningful conclusions from them and so on and different pharmaceuticalset safeguards can be had in the using the iot technologyin the case of retail sector as well tasks such as inventory tracking smartphone purchasinganonymous analytics of consumer choices these are the different things that can be doneefficiently through the use of iot technology security is another biometric and facial recognitionlooks ah then the remote sensors ah and so on ah you know fingerprinting based or facerecognition based or different eye rays recognition based you knowso these technologies can be ah connected and use the with the help of ah iot ah theyyou know this this sort of security mechanisms can be developed now when we talk about thisinterconnectivity of different devices we see that this interconnection or connectivitybetween the different devices has evolved over the years first it started with theseindividual cash machines or the atms being internetworked the web became very popularso you know everybody connects to the internet or the web in order to get access to differentinformation send emails and so on and so forth many different things are performed by differentweb users at present smart picker meters then became popular so smart meters are used atdifferent homes in a city these smart meters they can be programmable and they can recorddifferent thingseven you can program the smart meters at your homes in order to do different things likeload balancing electrical load balancing efficient use of electricity ah you know using electricityduring non peak hours pricing accordingly in the pricing mechanic choosing differentoptions ah for service of electricity that is provided by the service provider and soon and then we have digital locks biometric based digital locks are very popularwe have smart healthcare smart vehicles smart cities and smart dusts so these are the differentah different technologies that have evolved these are the different connected you knowdevice based technologies that have evolved over the years so atm and web are relativelyold by now one comes from nineteen seventies the other one from nineteen nineties but smartmeters became very popular in the two thousands digital locks are very popular at presentso smartphones can be used as locks to lock and unlock unlock the doors remotely at yourhomes or at your businesses and these locked keys and so on they can be easily changedand one can be granted access to a particular facility one means in a business the employeesor the different guests they can be granted access to different facilities through thedigital locks much more easily than the conventional lockssmart healthcare connected vehicle smart vehicles you know ah these are quite common smart citiesas i was telling you is very very popular at present not only in india but throughoutthe globe so in smart city people are talking about deploying smart different ictin infrastructureah these infrastructure which can communicate with each other they can be used by differentowners and the different operations in a city ah and ah ah the different functions of thedifferent offices etcetera you knowso so all these things offices and different other public places all these things can bemonitored and the operations can be improved ah much more easily and ah also the informationdissemination because you know the all these different devices they are typically fittedwith sensors so these sensors are going to throw in lot of data so in this so so disseminationof this particular data is very important handling of this particular data is very importantin the context of smart cities smart dust is another thing where the computers thatare smaller than a grain of sand can be spread or injected almost anywhere to measure chemicalsin the soil or to diagnose problems in the human bodyso in the modern day iot people are talking about different applications such as smartparking structural health monitoring noise urban maps that means noise maps in a particularcity or an urban environment smartphone detection traffic condition smart lighting systems wastemanagement smart roads river flood monitoring smart grid tank monitoring water tanks etceteratank level monitoring photovoltaic ah installations water flow monitoring stock calculations accesscontrol presence of different liquids hazardous materials and so on and so forthlarge number of applications are envisaged in fact they you know there are many ah ahiot oriented systems have been built already they have been prototyped some have been muchmore advanced than in that than a simple prototype and these can be used for serving not onlythese applications that i just mentioned or ah ah but also a large number of differentother types of applications for example healthcare space applications and so on and so forththe number is many and you know anywhere that you see there is a problem iot is quite likelycan be used in order to improve the efficiency of the solution to that particular problemdifferent other applications such as forest fire detection air pollution monitoring snowlevel monitoring landslide monitoring and avalanche prevention actually landslide monitoringin our country there have been different institutions ah ah that have already developed systemsfor landslide monitoring ah ah so so without getting into the details of it let me proceedfurtherso we have earthquake early detection and monitoring seismic system seismic sensorshave been developed they can be connected they can be internet worked and so on waterleakage monitoring in a water water ah delivery system water transmission system in a cityradiation level monitoring explosive exclusive monitoring and hazardous gas monitoring supplychain control nfc payment intelligent shopping applications and smart product managementas i was telling you before you can in fact think of iot applications in almost any sphereof the society any sphere of life so what is expected in order to build iot is to havetrillions of sensors billions of smart systems millions of applications all of which aregoing to be internetwork they are going to be made synchronously operated in order toform in order to build iotdifferent enablers of iot in terms of in terms of enabling technologies we have from implementationsperspective different technologies such as you know smart homes smart factories and soon different sensors can be fitted ah and then and we also have ah different connectivityoffering devices such as rfids zigbee ah wifi ah wifi ah cellular connectivity six lowpanlora ah and so on and so forthso different connectivity offering ah technologies are required and in terms of implementationas i was telling you factories homes ah you know ah banks and ah transportation sectorah agriculture ah you know healthcare ah and so on and so forth all of these differenttechnologies are required and the other enabling technology is things like big data deep learningartificial intelligence sensor network regular network the regular wireless and wired networksso all of these are different enablers for buildings iotin terms of connectivity typically there are three layers of connectivity service servicelayer local connectivity and global connectivity for global connectivity we have the internetfor local connectivity we have components such as the gateway and for service levelusing different communication ah technologies such as these ah you know different servicescan be offered to different different application areas such as health care agriculture ah ahahyouknow businesses factories plants banks and so onin terms of the baseline technologies there are quite a few baseline technologies thatare that can be used machine to machine communication is one in machine to machine communicationone machine directly talks to another machine communicates with another machine withoutany human intervention we have the cyber physical systems where the cyber ah ah ah the physicalsystems are basically equipped with computer and connectivity computational and connectivitymechanismsso we have a cyber physical system which works hand in hand cyber one the cyber componentof the system works hand in hand with the physical component of the system so we havethe cyber physical system we have web of things which is sort of like ah the web person ofthe internet of things so iot and m to m these go almost hand in hand but there is a distinctionwhereas m to m is just concerned about communication and interaction between two machines or twodevices using technologies such as cloud regular internet and so onah in the case of iot iot the scope is much bigger so in iot we are talking about notonly machine to machine communication but different other things as well so m to m canbe construed to be a part of iot while m to m standards have a prominent place in theiot standard landscape however iot has a broader scope than m to m so there can be broaderrange of interactions not simply machine to machine interaction they can be interactionsbetween ah not only machines and machines things and things but also things and peoplethings and applications and people with applicationsiot and web of things internet of things and web of things are often confused to be theone and the same but there is a distinction the wave of things ah basically focuses moreon the use of web based technologies such as html five java script ajax php and so onand so forth over the regular iot to make iot smarter and web accessible there are alot of terminological interdependence when we talk about iotiot has similarity with internet of people which has a people focus iop ah from iot ahdifferent ah ah using iot different ah industry oriented machines and so on ah can be controlledso we have smart factories ah ah you know smart factories using a robots virtual realityand so on one can have industry four point zero which is an approach to ah the moderndaymechanization or improvement of the current day plans and industriesinternet of environment is another we have cps which is basically the cyberphysical systemswhere these systems basically autonomously they operate and they can in fact in an iotworld what can happen is these cps systems these different cps systems they can be internetworktogether in this particular ah ah internet that means the internet of things we havem to m machine to machine communicationi already mentioned to you maybe what can happen in a smart home machines such as thelighting system can talk to the cooling system directly the cooling system can talk to cancommunicate with the fans directly the fans can communicate with a mobile phone directlyor the mobile phone can communicate with a fan directly so as you can see that betweentwo different machines without any human intervention ah you know communication can take place andthis is known as m to mso with this we come to an end ah of this particular lecture and we are going to continuewith the introduction in the next part of the lecture as well and so far what we haveunderstood are the basics of internet of things the motivation behind internet of things thedifferent application areas the different main points the challenges that are involvedand what we are envisioning when we are talking about building internet of things in the futurethank you
