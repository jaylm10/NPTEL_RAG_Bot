in this lecture will try to understand a very important concept which is the ah coveragethe concept of coverage in sensor networks coverage is a very important problem becausewhat is required is using sensors or sensor networks we have to deploy the sensors ormore specifically the sensor nodes in a particular terrain in such a way that no point or nonone of the areas in that particular terrain left unsensed in that region so we have todeploy the sensors in such a way that none of the points in the terrain of interest whichhas to be that means which has to be sensed which has to be [surve/surveilled] surveilledit should not happen that there is such a point which is not within the sensing rangeof if any sensor node so this is basically known as the point coverage like this thereare different other types of coverage called area coverage ah then we have barrier coverageand different other types of coverage ah which have ah been researched upon ah in the literatureso we will try to understand this concept firstso we have an area of interest and what is required is to ensure that that particulararea of interest is covered is fully covered is fully covered by at least one sensor sothat there has to each and every point in that particular area has to be within thesensing range of at least one sensor so there is an alight terminology which is called theconnectivity and connectivity of the nodes is basically to ensure that all nodes thatmeans each and every node in the network from that point to the sink node there is somepath that is available to transmit the sensed informationso we have to ensure in the connective connectivity problem we have to ensure that all the nodesare connected in the network so that the sense data can be reach the sink node sensor coveragebasically studies how to deploy or activate sensors to cover the monitoring area so thereare two variants of this particular problem one is called the sensor placement problemand the other one is the density control so basically we have to ensure that how we aregoing to deploy the sensor nodes in a particular region of interest so that the problem ofcoverage is addressed so how do we place the sensor nodes and the second problem is thatminimally how do we place so that you know appropriate or desirable density is maintainedin the ah in that particular area so there are two modes of ah sensors one isthe static sensor the other one is mobile sensor the problem of coverage with staticsensors basically is different from the problem of coverage with mobile sensors whereas instatic sensors we are primarily concerned about how to deploy the sensor so that eachand every point in the area is covered in mobile sensors we have to ensure that withrespect to not only space as in static sensor but also with respect to time that means spatiotemporally that region of interest is covered with respect to space and time and that isin harder problem to solve now let us try to understand few conceptsthe first is the concept of sensing range and transmission range so when we have a nodelike this it can sense up to a certain radius around it so it is typically like few metersor so so for a particular sensor node the sensing radius is the sphere around it tillwhich this particular node this particular node can sense so this is the sphere we aretalking about or in two d it is a circle now there is this allied concept of transmissionrange which is bit different so this transmission range or the communication range is concernedabout how far this particular node can communicate so these are concentric circles and typicallythe sensing range is lower than is lesser than the communication range as shown in thisparticular figure but in literature on coverage you will often find that the sensing rangeand the communication range are equated they are considered to be equal so there is a relationshipbetween the coverage and connectivity if the transmission range is greater than or equalto twice the sensing range it has been shown by researchers that the problem of coverageimplies the problem of connectivity in other words we simply have to take care of coverageand if we have ensured that coverage has been taken care of in a particular area then automaticallyconnectivity is also taken care of so for ensuring coverage as well as connectivitywe have to ensure that for the particular sensor node that we are considering the transmissionrange is at least twice the sensing range and typically for most of the available sensornodes in the market most of the ah you know so so this particular condition is taken careof so typically the the the transmission range or the communication range is quite ah ahmuch much bigger than the sensing range and that is why coverage becomes the main issueto be addressed so the problem of coverage once again ensuresthat how well the sensing field is monitored or tracked by the different sensors and todetermine that with respect to certain application specific performance criteria in the caseof static sensors where to deploy and or activate them and in case of mobile sensors how toplan the trajectory of the sensors so these two cases are collectively termed as the coverageproblem in wireless sensor networks so we have the coverage problem for static sensornetworks concerned mostly about how to place the sensors or if they are already placedhow to activate them when and how to activate them so this is the problem of coverage forstatic sensors the problem of coverage for mobile sensors is basically how to plan thetrajectory of these mobile sensors so that the region of interest is covered spatiotemporalyso the purpose of deploying a sensor network is to collect relevant data for processingor reporting and there are two types of reporting one is event driven the other one is on demandeven driven ah applications include like forest fire monitoring building fire monitoring andso on so whenever there is some kind of event ah so event means like fire taking place thatis an event ok so then ah that particular event is reported and on demand is basicallythat ah for example if there is a if there is some information that is required ah thenah that ah ah you know some query is going to be sent ah for example in inventory controlsystems so query is sent whenever there is some ah information that is required so theobjective is to use a minimum number of sensors and maximize the network lifetime and networklifetime is basically in plain and simple terms it is about how long the network isgoing to survive how long the network is going to survive so actually in the literature thereare different definitions of network lifetime ah so one definition basically says that thetime until which the first sensor node in the network dies there is another definitionwhich says that the time until which the last sensor node in the network dies that meansit runs out of battery power or it you know it stops functioning and there is there aredifferent other definitions as well which are somewhere in between so the time untilwhich let us say p percentage of sensors die in a particular network is the network lifetimeso basically the objective is to use a minimum number of sensors and maximize the networklifetime so this coverage problem is such that it can be addressed either using centralizedalgorithms or using distributed algorithms or using localized algorithms in distributedversion of the problem the nodes basically compute their position by communicating withtheir neighbors only ok every node basically computes their position by communicating onlywith their neighbors in the decentralized version the data are collected at the centralpoint and global map is computed and in the localized version here basically it is sortof like a distributed algorithm where only a subset of the nodes in the sensor networkparticipate in sensing communication and computation so it says sort of like a variant of the distributedalgorithm localized algorithm so the different ways in which the sensorscan be deployed for the purpose is basically either using deterministic means like youknow you pre plan everything in a particular area you know that xyz coordinates where eachof these individual sensor nodes are going to be deployed and that is pd determined pcalculated and the other one is basically random where using some random means likeairborne means or whatever the sensors are thrown into that particular areaso there are two types of ranges one is the sensing range and the other one is the communicationrange and the objective of the problem is to maximize the network lifetime or minimizethe number of sensors there are basically mostly three types of coverage that are quitecommon one is the area coverage the second is the point coverage and the third is thebarrier coverage so area coverage out of these three is the most common form of coveragein area coverage what has to be done is we have to ensure that each and every point ina particular area is within the sensing range of at least one sensor node and that is thatarea covered so likewise actually that entire area is it consists of infinite number ofpoints so we have to ensure that those infinite number of points each and [eve/every] everypoint in a particular area is within the sensing range of at least one sensor node and on areacoverage lot of work has been done by zhang ahd hou hou proved that if the communicationrange is rc and the sensing range is rs then if the condition rc greater than equal totwice of rs holds then coverage implies connectivity and this is something that i told at the outsetas well of this lecture so this is what has to be done so what basicallyhas to be done is we have to ensure that two discs intersecting at crossings will be determentand then we have to ensure that likewise there are you know all these crossings that areformed out of the intersection of the different circles are covered and this is what the algorithmone of the algorithms that was proposed by zhang and hou the ogdc algorithm that we goingto ah talk about shortly ah basically does and you know so without going into the detailsof it it me also explain the concept of point coverage so in point coverage what we aredoing is we are ensuring that if there is a set of points in a particular area to ensurethat those set of points are covered those set of points are covered in that particulararea with minimal number of sensor nodes so it comes in two flavors one is the randompoint coverage and the other one is the deterministic point coverage in random point coverage itis required to distribute the sensors randomly so that every point must be covered by atleast one sensor at all times and in deterministic point coverage we have to do essentially thesame thing in a deterministic manner then we have the barrier coverage in barrier coveragewe have three variants one is the one barrier coverage the second is the two barrier coverageand the third is the k barrier coverage so here we have to ensure that a particularbarrier is covered so let me just explain to you this particular concept let us saythat we have two countries let us say that we have two countries and we have this iscountry one and this is country two so this let us assume is the border between thesetwo countries so the barrier coverage problem says that how we are going to place the sensornodes and at what interval we are going to place them so that this particular barrieris covered covered means what that let us say that if there is some intruder that getsinto from country one it tries to get into country two then it will get detected by atleast one sensor node so this is the barrier coverage problemso one barrier coverage ensures that at least one sensor node detects the intruder in whati just explained before two barrier coverage ensures that you know at least two sensorsdetect such an intrusion and k barrier coverage ensures that at least k number of sensorsk can be anything greater than two k number of sensors basically detect this particularintrusion so we have different types of barrier coveragethe left hand figure shows thus case of weak coverage and the right hand side figure showsthe case of strong coverage so as you can see over here in this scenario we have weakcoverage because you know one can find paths by which one can you know avoid getting sensedavoid getting sensed on the other hand if you look at over here there is no such pathsthat can be found without getting detected without the intruder getting detected by oneof these sensor nodes so in this particular figure what we see is that these empty circlesbasically denoting the nodes which are there but an not active and these shaded circlesdenoting the nodes which are active so i hope that this point is clear over here so we haveweak coverage and we have strong coverage so as you can see over here so a path likethis by an intruder can avoid getting detected by add at least one sensor node however nosuch path can found out over here so this is the case of strong coverage and this isthe case of weak coverage so what is required is to continuously ensurethat the coverage criterion is mate at all points of time and we have to activate thenodes in that manner maybe if it is a random deployment there could be some redundant nodesand it there is no point of two nodes doing the same thing at the same time so maybe youput one node to the slip state the other one could be active and then this cycle can bechanged over time so a region like this has to be covered soin this particular region we have these different sensors we have these different sensors sowe have to ensure that we have to ensure that each and every point is covered so how dowe do that we keep on placing this sensor nodes and let us say that this is the sensingrange of this node this is the sensing range of the second node and this is the sensingrange of the third node so these points that are shown over here are termed as the crossingsthese points and these points what is the difference over here these points are crossingsbetween two circles two or more circles whereas these points are crossing between a circleand the boundary so we have one two three and four four crossingsso a continuous region r is covered if there exists crossings in r and every crossing inr is covered so we have to ensure that there are crossing in this particular region andwe do see that there a crossings in this region and then we have to ensure that every crossinglike this crossing this crossing this crossing each and every crossing again has to be coveredlike this crossing ah in this particular figure is not covered this crossing is not coveredwhereas this particular crossing which was formed out of these two circles is coveredby this circle so this crossing is covered whereas this crossing this crossing or thesecrossing these are not covered so this is what has to be ensured and this is shown ina different way in this particular diagram so now let us look at a little bit of geometryso you know we have to come up with some optimality conditions optimality conditions for minimizingthe overlap while covering the crossings and that way we have to ensure that minimum numberof sensor nodes are utilized in order to cover covered the crossings so if nodes a and bare fixed like in this particular figure so if nodes a and b are fixed we have to placea nodes c we have to place a node c in such a way that o are equal to oqso a b we have to place c in such a way that or sorry o or equal to oq ok if nodes a band c all can change their locations then and that is quite possible so if nodes a band c all can change their locations then we can even have op equal to or equal to oqright so op equal to or equal to oq that can be very well done and if all nodes have thesame sensing range that means the circles have the same radius then the distance betweenthem is square root of three times rs the sensing range so a node in the ogdc algorithmwhat happeneds is first a node volunteers as a starting node and it starts broadcastinga message containing the ideal direction which is randomly selected if another node b whichis closest to the ideal distance and angle becomes active a node c covering p and closestto the optimal location becomes active and repeatedly it is required to cover the crossingsuncovered crossings with notes that incur minimum overlapso a node sleeps if its coverage area is completely covered so let me show you this particularconcept it to really so what we have we have one node we have another node both have thesame radius right so and these are the crossings this is one crossing and this is another crossingso the point that was made earlier was that we have to place this another node in sucha way sorry this is not correct so we have to place it in this way ok not this in sucha way that this this this is again let me let me do it once againso let us say that we have two different nodes and we have to place third node in such away that this one this one and this one at the same so in this diagram actually it isnot very precise so we have to do it in such a way op or oq so op equal to or equal tooq so what happens is that one node what it will do it will at a particular angle it willstart broadcasting a message ok then another node which is in this particular directionand in this angle that means in this particular direction and is closest to this particularnode that node has to be placed in this manner ok and like this if you consider this wholearea you keep on doing the same thing and ensure that the crossings are also coveredso what is going to happen like this you know so what we are going to get is all the crossingsgetting covered like this with a minimum number of sensor nodes ok so this is how the ogdcalgorithm works so node x starts the process it selects thefirst node y at a distance some distance from this particular node so this distance is whatsquare root of three times rs square root of three times rs it will choose this nodethen this node z is selected at a distance square root of three times rs from both xand y so from both x and y this has to be put square root of rs distance square rootof three times rs distance so this is square root of three times rs this is square rootof three times rs and this is square root of three times rsso let us go through this algorithm once again each node voluntarily participates with probabilityp in this case this node a participates with probability p it chooses a back of time randomlyif it does not hear anything from its neighbors it declares itself as a starting node it declaresits position and preferred direction so in this case it declares its current positionand the direction alpha on receiving messages from the starting node each node computesthe deviation from the desired position it chooses a back off time randomly when theback off time expires it sense the power on message then it declares its position andthe preferred direction the process continues until the entire area is covered as in thisparticular figure right so this node it started at a particular angle closest to it anothernode is chosen this particular node basically ah ah will be selected these crossings areformed another node c is chosen so square root of three times rs square root of threetimes rs square root of three times rs and then we have further crossings so you keepon placing the other nodes so that all the crossings are coveredso some highlights again a node initiates the process with the desired distance andangle other nodes calculate the deviation and the optimal one is chosen the processcontinues for all nodes and all cover nodes go to the sleep mode this process is continuedfor each round so with this we come to an end of the lecture on ah coverage and coverageis one of the very important issues in sensor networks because it ensures that each andevery point ah ah in the region of interest is covered or a set of points is covered andif it is each and every point is covered that is that area coverage problem and if it isa set of points that have to be covered then its a point coverage problem and it is thisarea coverage problem that is the most common and most popular form of coverage problemthat is ah addressed ah ah ah in the literature lot of research works have been gone intoit similarly there is the third type of coverage which is the barrier coverage here again ahah you know this is also very important because sensor networks are often used for unmanssurveillance in ah you know bordering areas between two countries and that is where ahyou know ah this particular rectangular strip or a strip of ah region between two countrieshas to be monitored using sensors so the coverage while ensuring that minimum number of sensornodes are used at and has to be placed in that particular border is a very importantproblem and is known as the problem of barrier coverage and we have finally discussed theah ogdc algorithm which is one of the important ah area coverage algorithms that have beenproposed and is quite popularly used in the sensor networks community thank you
