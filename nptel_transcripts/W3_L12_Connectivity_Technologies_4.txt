another very important protocol is bluetooth this bluetooth technology is heavily usedfor building iot connectivity we have already gone through zigbee we have also gone throughdifferent other allied technologies such as six lowpan such as hart wireless hart rfidand also nfc and this particular technology bluetooth is typically used for bit of differentkind of applications applications where it is required to form a personal area networkmaybe to replace the wireless wired connectivity between the different devices wired connectivityif you want to to to replace the cables between different devices bluetooth can be usedso you move the cables have wireless connectivity between them that can be done with the helpof bluetooth and this is this protocol that we are going to discuss in this particularlecture so if we look at the bluetooth technology this is particularly used for short rangecommunication personal area network for instance connecting different peripherals to a computerperipherals to a computer using bluetooth is a very commonly used application of bluetooththe second could be to transfer data using bluetooth between two mobile devices thesemobile devices of course need to have the bluetooth radio to be supported but if itis supported and now it is most of the mobile phones particularly the smartphones they areall enabled with bluetooth so you know one can transfer files music videosso on and so forth and this is something very common that we do commonly we transfer fileswe transfer different things between two bluetooth devices a very simple form of bluetooth configurationwhere we have two bluetooth devices a client and a server and the data is transferred betweenthese two devices a very simple kind of configuration now in this particular course in this particularlecture we are going to go through all these different applicationsso it is used bluetooth is used for short range communication and it is typically usedfor instances where it is required to replace the cable the existing cables have to be replacedso what is required is to have cable replacement protocols and that is why as we will see shortlythat we have an entirely different and entirely different protocol stack that is basicallyproposed for using bluetooth of course it does match with the osi layers tcpip and osilayers to a great extent but then we have a completely different set of layers withdifferent names in the bluetooth architecture and also we have separate protocols that arethat function in each of these different layers so we will go through it in a short whileso bluetooth one of the very good things about bluetooth is security bluetooth basicallyensures high level of security and another very distinctive feature is that bluetoothhelps in forming ad hoc networks so concepts such as ad hoc technology ad hoc piconetsare basically commonly used in the case of bluetooth bluetooth technology also like theprevious ones like hart etcetera etcetera that we covered in the previous lectures operatein the ism band two point four gigahertz to two point four eight four gigahertz it usesspread spectrum hopping full duplex signal at a nominal rate of sixteen hundred hopsper second it supports one mbps data rate which is quiteattractive short range high data rate communication is supported in bluetooth in bluetooth thereare three types of radios that we will typically find and they all operate in different wayswe have the class one radios class two radios and class three radios class three radioshave a range of up to one meter or three meters class two radios are most commonly found inmobile devices having a range of ten meters or thirty feet and class one radios are usedprimarily in industrial use cases having a range of hundred meters or three hundred feetin terms of connection connection establishment using bluetooth there are three differentphases the first one is the discovery or the inquiry phase this next one is the pagingphase and the third one is the connection phase so so so basically for connection establishmentthere are only three phases in the inquiry phase there is some kind of inquiry that runsfrom one bluetooth device and that particular bluetooth device basically what it does isit tries to discover other devices in its vicinityso this is so one bluetooth device it is trying to explore what are the other devices in itsvicinity so this is basically this discovery phase or the inquiry phase very simple thenext one is the paging phase where some kind of connection is formed between two bluetoothdevices that want to talk to each other so some kind of connection is formed and thethird one is the connection phase where a device either actively participates in thenetwork or enters a low power sleep mode there are different modes of operation ofbluetooth devices one is the active mode and this is the mode where the device basicallyis fully active fully functional in all different respects it actively transmits data it activelyreceives data and so on and so forth so it it is fully functional fully active the otherthree phases the sniff mode the hold mode and the park mode all these three differentmodes are basically power saving modes and they default in very minute ways in very finein different ways in a sniff mode the device basically sleeps and only listens for transmissionat a particular predetermined predefined interval in the hold mode this is also a power savingmode where a device sleeps for a defined period and then returns back to the active mode andin the park mode the slave will become inactive until the master tells it to wake back upso we have all these different four modes of operation of bluetooth devices the activemode fully functional fully active fully transmitting fully receiving and the other three modesthe sniff mode hold mode and park mode are all essentially power saving modes of differenttypes so this is the protocol stack that i was talkingto you about earlier so what we have we have the physical layerthen we have the baseband layer we have the l two cap and then there are some differentother layers and corresponding protocols that are supported in the top layers and then wehave the application layer so these are the different layers in the bluetooth protocolsi was telling you about cable replacement there are protocols such as rf comm protocolswhich will support traditional telephony protocols that will support service discovery protocolsthat will support other link layer functionalities such as llcso these are the different functionalities that can be supported on top of this ah umah um that the physical baseband l two cap layers in bluetooth now this basically canbe mapped to the traditional osi layers and so these are the osi layers so here againyou have the physical layer you have the link layer you have the different middleware youhave the application layer and the exact form of mapping is basically shown in this particularfigure in the slide so this is how it maps okso we have physical radio radio layer or physical layer baseband layer l two cap and this ahyou know llc rf comm telephony service discovery and the application layer and this is howthey map to the osi traditional osi layers so baseband layer or the physical the onethat is above the physical here basically so physical is basically nothing but the radioand you know we dont need to really understand baseband is the physical layer of bluetoothit manages physical channels and links and different services such as error correctiondata whitening hop selection bluetooth security we are not going through a details of it itis not even required for you to know because you know if it is required then really youknow this is just you know we are just getting exposure to different protocols in this particularcourse so it is not required to really dig into toomuch deep of each of these protocols we just have to be exposed and things like you knowadding gaussian noise or you know error correction etcetera etcetera these are difficult theseare basically you know the different functionalities data whitening you know with the help of whitenoise you know gaussian noise etcetera etcetera you know so these are the things that arebasically supported in the baseband layer then we have the l two cap and in the l twocap which basically is on top of the baseband layer functionalities such as multiplexingmultiple logical connections between two bluetooth devices is functioned is made possible inthis using this particular layer so this particular functionality is implementedin the l two cap layer l two cap provides connection oriented and connection less dataservices to upper layer protocols provides protocol multiplexing capability segmentationso because basically you know when you are sending a video for instance so it cannotbe send to all at once right so it has to be segmented fragmented and segment wise ithas to be transmitted and then area assembly also has to be done in a subsequently so segmentationand reassembly and group abstractions you know so together forming of the groups abstractingthem ah and so similar kind of functionalities are all done at this higher up layer whichis the l two cap layer then we have on top different protocols suchas rf comm the full form is radio frequency communication protocol which is basicallya cable replacement protocol and the main purpose of rf comm or more specifically ahah ah in ah you know so bluetooth and more specifically rf comm is basically to replacethe serial cables that are already there that is to be traditionally used so use do awaywith the cables and introduce these protocols ah and that will basically make ah ah bluetootha cable replacement technology so this rf comm it works as an emulation ofthe rs two thirty two and if you remember rs two thirty two are presently it is alsoknown as eia two thirty two rs two thirty two is basically you know its a serial portcommunication protocol serial port communication protocol the traditional serial port communicationprotocol is rs two thirty two so this rs two thirty two it is emulated its behaviours areemulated in this particular protocol the rf comm protocol rf comm protocol it providesa simple reliable data stream to the user very similar to tcp and supports up to sixtysimultaneous connections between two bluetooth devicesthen finally we have the service discovery protocol and there are some telephony protocolsetcetera etcetera because which has to support the traditional telephony functions so weare not going through them service discovery protocol is very important because ultimatelywe are going to use bluetooth for offering different types of services to different applicationsso some some sort of service discovery has to happen so sdp enables the applicationsto discover available services and their features and sdp addresses the unique characteristicsof bluetooth environment such as dynamic changes in the quality of services in rf proximityof devices in motion and can function over a reliable packet transfer protocolso sdp it uses a service request response kind of model a request is sent a responseis received back ok now a very important concept i am going to explain to you which is verymuch important in order to understand bluetooth and this is known as the concept of piconetspiconet is some sort of a unit you know unit form of network in bluetooth unit form ofnetwork what does it mean so we have let us say let us look at this particular exampleso we are going to go through we have to understand how piconets workso what we have is something known as the master so we have m bluetooth node a bluetoothdevice which will act as a master and there can be different slave devices so we havea master we have different slaves so this entire thing is a piconet this is a piconetand how many of in a particular unit that means in a particular piconet in one piconetthere can be only one master only one master and one or more slaves how many up to howmany seven slaves so one two three up to seven slaves so there can be one master and oneup to seven slaves in a piconet ok now so this piconet we have one piconet wehave another piconet we have another piconet so this is one piconet this is another piconetthis is a third piconet so what we have are three different piconets and together allthese piconets put together is known as scatternet so this is the concept of scatternet in ascatternet you have several piconets put together working together and these piconets basicallytalk to each other via the gateway and this gateway nodes can be anything like you knowso it might so happen that you you have a master over here say that this is a masterand then you have different slaves slave slave slave here there can be another slave andthis slave of this piconet can act as a master in this particular piconetso you know the slave in one piconet can be a master in another piconet and then againit can have one or more slaves and this is the way you know this chain continues andtogether we have the concept of piconets and scatter nets so going back so we have bluetoothenabled devices that connect and communicate wirelessly for short range communication unitform of it unit network of it is the piconet the bluetooth devices exist in small ad hocconfigurations with the ability to act as either the master or the slave it provisionsto have one master and one or up to seven slaves in a particular piconetthe simplest configuration is a point to point configuration with one master and one slaveand where we get it this is something that we typically use a single master single slavekind of configuration is something that we use typically to exchange files to exchangevideos to exchange images graphics and so on between ah between our mobile devices sowhen we are using our smartphones we turn turn on the smartphones to ah turn on thebluetooth in our smartphones to of ah you know two devices and then from one such devicea image can be sent a file can be sent to another such device after the discovery orthe initiation phase it can be sent using this particular configurationso we have one master one slave kind of configuration so when more than two bluetooth devices communicatewith one another it is called a piconet a piconet can contain up to seven slaves clusteredaround a single master the device that initializes establishment of the piconet becomes the masterand the master is responsible for transmission control by dividing the network into a seriesof time slots using tdma so basically what happens is within a piconet we have a masterand we have you know up to seven slaves so what the master does is it will have todivide the time that is allotted into different slots and we will have to distribute thoseslots among the slave nodes in that piconet and the master will have to ensure that periodicallythis thing is done and is distributed to the different slaves in its piconet so this isthe job of the master in a piconet so this is the diagram showing the configuration ofpiconet and scatter net so we have within a piconets we here what we see we have a scatternet consisting of two piconets this is one piconet this is another piconet and we seethat there is a master and there are three slaves rather four slaves and this slave isacting as a bridge between these two piconets and these are again three different slavesfor this particular piconet and here as you can see over here we havedistinct masters in each of these piconets its not like the same master in fact whatwe could have had is this bridge which is a slave for this piconet would have also beenconfigured in such a way that it would act as a master for this piconet this is alsopossible so the master of the slave they use the forty two bit addressing ok so this isthe addressing scheme that is used each piconet device will support seven simultaneous connectionsto other devices each device can communicate with several piconets simultaneously and piconetscan establish dynamically and automatically as bluetooth enabled devices enter and leavepiconets so they can basically configure self configurethey can change you know devices cant the bluetooth devices can get into a piconet cango go out of the piconet dynamically and the topology changes accordingly so all thesethings are featured in a piconet there is no direct connection between the slaves allconnections are either through the master to slave or slave to master mode slaves areallowed to transmit once these have been polled by the master transmission starts in the slaveto master timeslot immediately following a polling packet from the master and the devicecan be member of two or more piconets and this is something that i explained earlieras well in one piconet that that particular devicecan be a slave in another piconet it can even act as a master and together you put all thesepiconets and what you get is a physically extended infrastructure comprising of severalpiconets known as the scatternet applications of bluetooth are quite common audio playershome automation systems smartphones toys hands free headphones sensor networks they all areusers of bluetooth so the bluetooth is a very important technology that we have just coveredand it is quite heavily used for building iot systems zigbee hart bluetooth nfc rfidthese are all like different technologies that can be used for establishing connectivitybetween different nodes for building up iot they all have their different distinct featuresand we have already seen that in the previous lecture we have seen that how hart wirelesshart and zigbee differ from each other and now it is also quite evident how bluetoothdiffers from zigbee so for bluetooth we can have high data rate communication comparedto no data rate in the case of zigbee but zigbee is consumes much lower power comparedto bluetooth so there are pros and cons depending on the application in in fact what can alsohappen is we could be using all of these technologies together in parallel and we can have a bluetoothworking with zigbee zigbee working with hart etcetera etcetera and so all all these thingsare possible zigbee primarily consumer iot hart wirelesshart primarily industrial iot but it doesnt even matter you you can even put all of themtogether for maybe industrial iot or on the other hand consumer iot so this can also bedone so these are that all these powerful technologies that can be used for buildingiot systems thank you
