so this particular lecture is on actuation so based on the readings of the sensor wehave already seen different types of sensors in the previous lecture and based on the readingsof these different types of sensors some action might be required to be taken and that isdone by actuators these actuators basically perform certain actions on the environmenton another system on a device and so on so there are different examples of actuatorsi am going to show you a different types of actuators very shortly but these actuatorsthey can have principle of working principles which are based on electronics ah then electricalthen ah you know mechanical ah systems and so on so they basically you know use somekind of control control behavior some control signals are sent ok so this is how these actuatorsthey perform we are going to go through the different mechanisms ah ah ah behind ah thefunctioning of these actuators in this particular lecturebefore we proceed i wanted to show you at the outset some of these actuators that canbe used so here is here is an example ah of a sample actuator which is known as the relayswitch so this relay switch it is an electromechanical switch it is an electromechanical switch whichcan be used to switch between ac and dc for instance or different other things can beperformed so the sensor networks the sensor nodes they typically operate in dc and basedon the sensed value maybe you know you want to switch off the electricity in your roomor at your home based on maybe something maybe fire has been detected by the sensor networkthen you want to do something you want to turn off the power in your homeso that is that is ac that operates on ac right so this particular switch this electromechanicalswitch will basically turn off the the ac ah that the power supply at your home thiscan help to help in doing it so this is an example this is known as the relay there isanother one which is the solenoid ah valve and ah um this basically can help in controllingthe flow of liquid so you have an input you have an output so we have an input we havean output and the solenoid valve if we open it so ah what we can what we can see overhere is ah what is in side so you know so water can flow in and depending on the conditionsthis valve is going to either allow the water to flow out or it is going to stop it is notgoing to allow so this is another actuator like this thereare different actuators that are available for use in iot so having seen some real lifeah actuators let us try to understand the basic principles of actuators but before thatlet us go through some of the basics so an actuator he is a component of a machine ora system that moves or controls the mechanism of the system that moves or controls the mechanismof the system so typically these actuators are based on some control system these controlsystems they act on the environment so an actuator basically requires some kind of acontrol signal and a source of energy for their functioningso typically so i said that control signals are required for the actuators so when theseactuators receive a control signal they respond by converting that energy into mechanicalmotion some mechanically something is going to be done this is an example of course sothey convert that electrical signal some control signal into mechanical motion and that controlsystem can be simple which can be based on some mechanical or electronic system or itcan be software based like a printer driver robot control system a human or any otherinput so what we have are three types one threetypes of actuators one is these electric based actuators we have this pressure based actuatorsand we have these mechanical based actuators each of these they send control signals andbased on that the actuation is going to be performed so we have hydraulic actuators pneumaticactuators electrical actuators thermal actuators magnetic actuators and mechanical actuatorsso this name suggests these hydraulic actuators consist of a cylinder or fluid motor thatuses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation the mechanical motion is convertedto linear rotary or oscillatory motion so basically you know when some fluid passesthrough so then you know that motion is converted to some linear motion or some oscillatorymotion or rotary motion and since liquids are nearly impossible to compress most ofthe hydraulic actuators basically exert considerable force so that is the reason why liquid basedactuators are typically used you know so these are quite popular because of this particularreason on the left hand side we see an example of an hydraulic actuator which is based onthe use of oil so in this particular cylinder oil will be there and then when you put whenyou apply pressure on it it is going to give an output based on which there can be somelinear motion or some oscillatory motion or rotatory motion or whatever that can be performedso here on the right hand side we see over here a figure which shows an hydraulic actuatorbased an hydraulic actuator based radial engine so as we can see over here this is quite thisanimation is quite ah you know it is ah quite explanatory so as we can see over here youknow so liquid goes inside and when you synchronize the liquid going inside from these differentdirections then what happens is you can emulate a rotatory motion like this so this basicallycan help in the functioning of an engine so it can give a rotatory motion in this mannerso those were the hydraulic actuators pneumatic actuator pneumatic means air based a pneumaticactuator basically converts the energy formed by vacuum or compressed air at high pressureinto either linear or rotatory motion so you know the rack and pinion actuatorsare typically the pneumatic actuators and these are used for valve controls of waterpipe water pipes pneumatic actuators basicallyexert a lot of forceand for example the pneumatic brakes can be very responsive to small changes in pressurethat are applied by the driver so pneumatic brakes are quite common in different liketrucks etcetera they use pneumatic brakes so hydraulic brakes are more common in carsin trucks the pneumatic brakes are quite common so these pneumatic brakes the advantage isthat they are very very responsive to small changes you know if you ah if the x ray ahif the brake is pressed little bit you know they become they act quite fast this is anadvantage of these pneumatic actuators so basically what happens is the pressure thatis put on the brake that is converted into force pretty fast so this is one of the advantagesof these pneumatic sensors so here is an a a figure of a pneumatic sensor when you applypressure over here so this shaft this crankshaft or this shaft will move and this is an exampleof a pneumatic actuator so basically this is a figure which showsan air pump acting as a pneumatic actuator then we have we have seen hydraulic actuatorswe have seen pneumatic actuators and then we have the electric actuators an electricactuator is generally powered by a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanicaltorque so this electrical energy is used to actuate the equipment such as the solenoidvalve which control the flow of water in pipes in response to electrical signals and thisis what i was showing you at the outset i showed you one of the actuators the solenoidvalve i had shown you and this basically works on the principle of electrical actuatorso on the left hand side is an is a figure showing a motor drive based rotary actuatorok so basically you know so what happens is ah this basically ah ah you know the electricalsignal over here will help in moving this and so it is going to give a rotary motiona rotary motion of this particular part so this is an example of a motor drive basedrotary actuator here in this particular animation what you see is an electric the functioningof an electric bell an electric bell is an example of a solenoid based ah actuator asolenoid based actuator so as you can see over here once the ah thebell is pressed then the connectivity is established and then the electromagnetic field is generateddue to which the bell sounds due to which the bell sounds and this is the way in whichsolenoid based electric bells functions so these are two examples of electrical ah electricalactuators then we can have thermal or magnetic actuators which can ah so thermal or magneticactuators these can be actuated by applying thermal or magnetic energy and ah typicallythey are very popular because of being that they are very compact lightweight economicaland with high power density so these active actuators use shape memorymaterials or shape memory alloys smas and this is very popular at present so this ishow it works so this is an example of an sma based piezo motor so as you can see over herethese are the different steps in which it works so these are these are the two metalstrips and when ah um you know when the energy is passed through it they bend and when theybend they basically move this red and white strip mechanically so this basically actsas an actuator so these this is like a joint metal bar andwhen you so this is like this sorry ah so when you heat this metal bar this is an alloybar consisting of two metal strips and ah so you know the property is that when youheat it ah then it is going to bend and when it bends it is going to move this particularstrip in this manner so the different steps are shown over here and this is quite evidentit is quite explanatory from this from this steps so this is an example of a coil gunwhich basically works on the principle of magnetic actuation so this is also quite explanatoryso this coil gun you know so basically you know electromagnetic field is generated andthen you know again it is pushed and so on ah and this is howah so basically the you know functioning of the hyper loops at present people are talkingabout hyper loops right so presenting ah if the functioning of the hyper loops are alsoah um you know based on this particular principle then we have these mechanical actuators whichbasically converts rotatory motion into linear motion to execute some move movements so thisbasically involves these gears the pinions gears pinions rails pulleys chains and otherdevices to operate so rack and pinion is an example of a mechanical actuator the figureshows it and it is quite exponentially from thisso as it moves basically this also moves so a crankshaft is another example of a mechanicalactuator so this is how the crankshaft works so as this thing moves in this manner so thisgives this one a mechanical motion a rotatory motion there are different soft actuatorswhich are actually polymer based and the design to handles fragile objects like fruit harvestingin agriculture or in biomedicine handling internal organs of human beings and typicallythese are used in robotics so soft actuators are also quite popular and these basicallyuse something known as the s smps the shape memory polymers which are actually polymersand the behavior of the polymers will change depending on the stimuli the stimuli for thesepolymers are the light electrical signals magnetic signals heat ph etcetera etceterathey have different properties these polymers they behave differently ah due to these differentvariations variations in these physical properties then we have the light activated from polymersthese polymers basically get activated through light stimuli and ah these are also quiteah popular so what we have seen are different actuators their actuation principles and differentdiagrams and figures of them and at the outset we have already seen some real actuators thatcan be used ah for ah for building iot based systemsthank you
