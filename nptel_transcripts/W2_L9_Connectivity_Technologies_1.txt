so far what we have gone through and have understood at the different basic conceptsthat are involved in the networking aspects of iot so we have gone through different protocolsand these protocols include the xmpp protocol the mq ah tt protocol coap protocol cope andthe a ah the amqp protocol so these are the different protocols that we have gone throughso far and these protocols are primarily involved with service offeringsso they are at the higher level and now we are going to understand we are going to godown and we are going to understand that more at the physical level and so physical andpartially mac so are the link layer at physical level and link layer level what are thesedifferent protocols there are there these protocol scan as a whole offer connectivityto the different devices which can help in physical establishment of the networkso we are now going to go through some of these protocol so when we talk about theseprotocols this can be used for both consumer iots and industrial iot so consumer iot meanslike smart home ah ah then ah different applications of smart home ah ah then for different servingdifferent applications ah for ah you know consumer ah devices ah consumer based systemsand so on ah then for industrial iot it is like connecting different machines ah theindustrial machines ah manufacturing machines and so on offering different connectivitiesand smart intelligence on top of ah those devices and so onso so all these ah different protocols that are listed ah in front of us for example ahthis i triple e eight zero two point fifteen point four which is a protocol as well asstandard as well ah this can be used zigbee is very much useful six low pan wireless hartz wave isa one hundred bluetooth nfc and rfid so we are going to go through most of theseprotocols in the subsequent lectures so we will start with the first one which is theeight zero two point fifteen point four which is an i triple e standard and this basicallyis used for forming wireless personal area networkso personal skill personal skill means like you know in the skill of person so personalarea network are used for forming network at person skill ah and so these are basicallynormally low data rate networks and ah so ah this basically are developed for low datarate monitoring and control so monitoring mean sensing low data rate sensing ah thencontrol ah maybe through actuation and so onand in the process offering because it is low data rate and is used for wireless personalarea network these can help in offering extended life time to the networks extending the lifetimeof the network because of the reduced power consumption so this standard uses two sublayers ah two layer sorry ah two layers one is the physical layer the other one is themac layer plus the sub layers like logical link control the sscs which is the servicespecific convergence sublayer etcetera ah to communicate with the upper layers but thisparticular standard it focuses on primarily the two layers which is the physical and macso physical mac partly llc and sscs that's it about eight zero two point fifteen pointfour as such so before before we go any further i would like to remind you that in this casethe communication takes place in the ism band so this is what i was explaining to you sofar this particular standard this particular protocol this defines specifications thisgives specifications for operating in the physical layer mac layer sscs and llc sublayers and how these are going to connect with the network layerso but the main focus is on the physical layer and the data link layer of the traditionalosi stack so few features that we are going to just list over here and we are not goingto go through them in detail because here i am assuming that ah ah i mean you have asome basic background in networks and communication ah if you have you will be able to ah understandthese a little betterhowever if you dont have you know this is just for you to remember we cannot go throughthe details of how these ah communication ah technologies these different schemes theywork so this eight zero two point fifteen point four it is based on the modulation schemeswhich is known as the d triple s which is direct sequence spread spectrum techniqueso this is the modulation scheme that it uses d triple s modulation schemeso these basically is highly tolerant of the noise and interference and offers link reliabilityimprovement mechanisms so this particular standard is helpful in environments whichare noise prone have lot of interferences and in a presence of noise and interferencethis particular standard can help in improving the reliability of the network so it has twodifferent variants two different versionsthe low speed version basically uses the bpsk and the high speed version uses what is knownas the offset qpsko qpsk and for ah mac communication it uses the csmaca ah for channel access thatmeans ah carrier sense multiple access ah ah and ah carrier sense multiple and ca standsfor basically collision avoidance so carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidanceis used for channel access and multiplexing basically allows multiple users of nodes tocommunicate with one another ah in an interference free banner at different times over the samechannelso power consumption using this particular protocol is minimized due to the infrequentlyoccurring very short transmissions with low duty cycle which is less than one percentso the minimum power level that is defined in this particular standard is minus threedbm or point five microwatts the transmission for most of these cases is line of sight transmissionand however non line of sight transmission is also possible but you get better efficiencybetter performance if line of sight communication is usedthe standard transmission range basically varies between ten meters to seventy fivemeters seventy five meters will particularly be obtained if it is used outdoors but forindoor environments typically like ten meters to i would say above thirty forty meters andso on so the best case transmission that is ah ah received ah for outdoors ah can be evenup to thousand meter also in certain cases but typically you know so ah that is a theoreticalpossibility but ah typically you do not get that much of a ah transmission range evenif it is outdoors that networking technologies that is support that are supported are thestar topology and the mesh topologyso there are different variants of eight zero two point fifteen point four so so withinaxel before we proceed further eight zero two point fifteen point four the i triplee standard is useful for forming ah wireless personal area network that means small rangelow data rate low power consuming networks this can use the eight zero two point fifteenpoint four now this basically has different variants the base variantsare a and b butthere are variants like the c variant which is used for china the d for japan the e variantis used for industrial applications the f variant for active rfid uses the g for smartutility networks such as smart gridsso these are the different variants of the eight zero two point fifteen point four whichare typically used for different purposes in different parts of the world now eightzero two point fifteen point four can these networks can be classified into two typesthe beacon enabled network the other one is non beacon enabled network and we so we willlook at what is beacon enabled and non beacon enabledah shortly and also these networksbasically use different types of devicesone is the ffd which stands for fully functional device ffd the other one is the reduced functionaldevice the rfd the fully functional devices include the pan coordinator that means a personalarea network coordinator the router or the device they can act as full functional devicewhich can undertake all different types of functionalities where as the reduce functionaldevice can only sends and sent and something very similarso they have reduced functional if they cannot route they cannot switch they cannot sendthe packetsthey cannot read a packetsand so on so they can only do very simple thingsthese are the rfds reduced function devices so once again we have the fully functionaldevice which can talk to all types of devices and can support full protocols the reducedfunctional devices can only talk to a fully functional device has lower power consumptionand uses minimal cpu and ram so minimal processing and storageso there different frame formats frame types that are defined for eight zero two pointfifteen point four so there are typically five frames there are typically five framesthat are defined for eight zero two point fifteen point four so we have the data framethe acknowledgement frame the command frame the mac frame and the beacon frame so didan acknowledgement i do not need to elaborate further because these are quite obviousthe command frame is used for things such as different control functions such as associatinga device with a pan coordinator or disassociating a device or performing different other controlfunctions so there are the command frames and then the mac frames also do not need toelaborate further this is standard and then we have the beacon framesthis beacon frames physically what they do is this pan coordinator at regular intervalsof time they in basically sends these beacons which can basically advertise its presentand the different devices that are able to get the signal that means the beacon formthat is broadcast by this particular pan coordinator these device they know the that there is thispan coordinator which is present so this is basically enable this particular functionalityis enabled with the help of this beacon framesso going back to the previous classification we have seen that we have a beacon enablednetwork and the non beacon enablednetwork so what is this beacon enabled network soin beacon enabled network basically periodically pan coordinator it is going to send periodictransmissions of beacon messages so periodically beacon messages are going to be transmittedwhichare going to be received by different devices which one to get associated with the pan andso onthen the data frame are sent via slotted csma ca with a super frame structure that is managedby the pan coordinator the beacons are used for synchronization and association of othernodes with the coordinator and the scope of operation basically spans the whole networkin the context of beaconed beacon enabled networks in case of non beacon enabled networksthedata frames are sent viaun slotted csmacathe previous one for beacon enabled network it was the slotted csms ca but in the caseof non beacon enabled network it is the un slotted csma ca the beacons are used onlyfor link layer discovery and that means whether there is any connectivity where is there isany link from one device to another and so on so beacon messages basically will helpin the discovery of these different links from the pan coordinator to the differentdevices and so onso these basically network this typeof networkthat means the non beacon enabled network requestboth the source and the destination ids so as eight zero two point fifteen point fouris primary a mesh protocol it is primarily based on a mesh protocol all the protocoladdressing must adhere to the mesh configuration so this is basically in a axel how the eightzero two point fifteen point four protocol functions and the different features of itwe are now going to look at the zigbee protocol which is heavily used for iot applicationsfor establishing connectivity between the different nodes and this zigbee as we willsee shortly is basically it works on top of the eight zero two point fifteen point fourfor extending this functionalities to the different other layers so if you recall eightzero two point fifteen point four is useful for establishing connections and functionfunctionalities in the physical layer and the mac layer and zigbee basically will takethese functionalities to the higher layers network and beyond network layer and beyondso let us look at how zigbee basically functions so zigbee protocol is defined by the layerthree and above so it work it works on top of layers one and two of eight zero two pointfifteen point fourand extends to layer three and above and zigbee basically works on topof eight zero two point fifteen point four so this is something that we have to understandand we have to remember that there is a difference between eight zero two point fifteen pointfour and zigbeeand this is what many people often confused people think that zigbee and eight zero twopoint fifteen point fourare one and the same but it is not so zigbee is definitely basedon the eight zero two point fifteen point four but it has its own distinct identityso the zigbee basically uses layer three and layer four to define additional communicationenhancements and these enhancements include authentication with valid nodes encryptionfor security and a data routing and forwarding capability that enables mesh networking andzigbeeis typically used in wireless sensor network applications it is heavily used inwireless sensor network applications where mesh topologies are formed with the help ofzigbeeso this is a diagraph diagram which basically shows the position of zigbee with respectto eight zero two point fifteen point four so where is eight zero two point fifteen pointfourit focus is mostly on the five and the mac layers zigbee takes it beyond mac beyondnetwork layer so network layer and the rest of the layers all the way up to the applicationlayer basically this extension or the enhancement is made possible with the help of zigbee overthe eight zero two point fifteen point four protocolin zigbee there are primarily two different components the first one is known as the zdowhich stands for zigbee device object and it takes care of ah issues such as devicemanagement security provisioning policies and so on so these are the different functionalitiesof the zdo that that means the zigbee device object component the second component is apswhich stands for application support sublayer which takes care of services such as ah controlservices interfacing bridging between network and other layers and so on so these are thetwo distinct components with separate functionalities as we have just gone throughso zigbee basically supports star topology so this is the star topology that we see overhere and we do not need to elaborate on this furtherso we have this controller node andwe have these different age devices and these age devices they form a star topology withthe ah the the coordinator node sorry ah its not the control know its a coordinator nodealong with the coordinatorthen we have this coordinator node can be a gate way node also and this can be a simplelocal area network a simple local area network or local area network equivalent then we havethe cluster tree topology where these are like different clusters that are formed withthese different blue colored cluster head which basically in reality are things suchas routers and hubsso these will act as routers and this routers will form a tree like structure with the coordinatornode so this is why this is known as the cluster tree topology and then we have the mesh topologywhich is forming a mesh network with the help of these different routers these differentrouters they form a mesh backbone kind of network and to each of these routers thesedifferent in devices are attachedso basically these green device are the end devices in this particular diagram and thesegreen devices attached to theseblue devices which basically denote ah ah the the routersand at the end of this mesh network on one end we have thiscoding then node which actsas a gateway and from this point on it offers connectivity to the outside network such asthe internetso in a mesh any nodecan communicate with any other node within its rangeso this isthe main advantage to offer faulty tolerance reliability meshtopologies are very much usefulso if the nodes are not in the range messages are relayed through intermediate nodes sothis allows the network ah ah deployment over large areas so using mesh topology you canextend the network to larger areas you can span across larger area so this is possiblewith the help of the meshtopologyso the meshes have increased network reliability for example if nodes c and f are down in thisparticular scenario so let us say that initially we had this kind of a mesh now if the nodesc and f these routers are down for one reason or another the messages can still go froma to z using this particular path because an alternative path was possible to have inbecause its a mesh networknow the zigbee mesh networks are self configuring and self healing self healing is quite obviousbecause if there is some link failure or node failure or something it is possible to haveother alternative routes and ah yes they can configure on their own they can form the networkon their own so this is the advantage of the zigbee mesh network so in zigbee there aredifferent entities the first one is the zigbee coordinator the zc the zigbee in the coordinatorbasically forms the root of the zigbee networkso the entirenetwork or the network tree has a route and this route is known as the zigbeecoordinator and form this coordinator there is a single so first of all there is a singlecoordinator and from this coordinator there is a single hop connectivity to the end devicesor ah so or any other device so so ah so this coordinatorbasically stores information aboutthe network which is under it and which is outside itso basically you know its sort of buffers some of these information that i receivedfrom this end devices and stores with it ah for certain time it buffet it for some certaintime so it also act as a trust center and repository for the security keys then comesthe zigbee router which is capable of running applications as well as relaying informationbetween the different nodes that are connected to it and then we have the end device whichcontains just enough functionality to talk to the parent node and it cannot relay datafrom other devices so it has reduced functionality so its a reduced functionality devicenow zigbee also incorporate a network layer so this network layer uses the ad hoc on demanddistance vector routing protocol which is ah the aodv protocol and it is been popularin the case of adhoc networks it is used mostly in the ad hoc networks for ah as a as a routingprotocol ah that operates in the network layer and it used to find the final destinationso how it can be found the aodv basically this particular protocol it broadcasts a routemessage to all its intermediate neighborsthese neighbors basically they relay the same information to their neighbors intern andeventually this message space across throughout the network the upon discovering of destinationa low cost path is calculated and is inform to the requesting device via the unicast messagingso this is how this particular protocol functions so zigbee has different applications it canbe used for building automation smart homes smart health care telecom services ah offeringlink connectivity to led lighting systems then smart energy for ah home energy monitoringah building automation i think i have already mentioned remote control and so on sothese are the different applications where this zigbee protocol can be used so we cometo an end of this so we have discussed two very important protocols i triple e eightzero two point fifteen point four and the zigbee protocol in this particular lecturewe have seen that where as the eight zero two point fifteen point four it is primarilyrestricted to the physical and the mac layers zigbee basically extends it or enhance itsenhances its functionality beyond so network layer and all the way up to application layerso zigbee basically uses the protocol aodv for routing purposes and it is one of thevery popular protocols that is used for ah sensor networking applications ah particularlyusing ah the mesh topology and we have all seen that there are different types of topologiesthat there star topology cluster tree topology mesh topology and so on mesh topology is particularlyuseful when there is higher reliability that is required from the network deployment forthe application for the which it is being usedthank you
