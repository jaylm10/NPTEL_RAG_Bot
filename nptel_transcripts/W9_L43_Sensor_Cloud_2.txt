so this is the second part of the lecture on sensor cloud in the first part we haveunderstood what is sensor cloud the advantages of sensor cloud over regular sensor networksand how sensor cloud can help in real life applications so we are now going to look atsome of the issues in the building of sensor cloud so you know just as a recap of whatwe discussed before in the first part when we talk about sensor cloud it is about integrationof two technologies one is sensor networks and cloud trying to take advantage of theinherent capabilities of dissemination of sensor networks so sensor networks are verymuch good in data acquisition and thereafter dissemination of this information and cloudbasically is good in terms of information storage data storageso trying to harness the advantages of both is what we try to do in sensor cloud so howis it done with the it is done with the help of the virtualization capabilities so in sensorcloud we are offering sensors as a service through the technology of virtualization bywhich these different sensors are virtualized and these virtual visualized instances ofthe sensors are made available to the different users to the different users of sensor cloudin sensor cloud architecture typically there are different types of users one is the endusers themselves the second is the sensor owners the third is the sensor cloud serviceproviderso like this there are there could be few other you know different types of actors orthe stake holders as well but typically we are talking about these stakeholders so whathappens is the sensor owner is the one who basically makes these ah you know who basicallyprocures and makes these sensors available they own the sensors they have purchased thesensors and they have made the sensors available for ah you know for use sensor cloud serviceprovider is mostly concerned about the supervision the management of the sensor services so theybasically in conjunction with the sensor owners they deploy the the the sensor nodes in theregion of interest in the area of interest like in the city or several cities they willbe deploying these different sensors at different points and then the sensor data are goingto be made available to the different usersso the sensors so so the though the main advantage of sensor cloud is through a virtualized platformthrough the technology of visualization the different owners are able to access thesedifferent sensor devices for for performing their own sensing tasks so what we have isbasically sensors as a service or even we can think of as the concept of sensing asa service so sensors as a service means that the sensors to whoever require you know whoever requires the sensors they would be able to get access to the services in the sameway as infrastructure is made available through a virtualized platform in cloud to the endusers the similar kind of analogous thing is done over here instead of infrastructurewe have the sensors and the sensors are made available to the usersso this is the whole idea of sensor cloud and in this particular back drop we have tounderstand that we if we have to develop if we have to develop this kind of infrastructureof sensor cloud how can we do it so let us look at some of these different issues sofirst one is the management issue first one is the management issue in sensor cloud sowe have different types of concerns what is the optimal composition of the virtual sensornodes what is the optimal composition of the virtual sensor nodes so what it means i willtalk about it shortly the second one is the data caching you know so what happens is forcertain applications it is not required to always prime the sensors physically at thephysical level you know the data do not change too much so you know data can be cached andcan be made accessible to the end users to the different users if the data is not verystale you know it can be made available to the end users as per the need and then isthe optimal pricing so pricing is very much important because its a service offering sensorcloud service provider is offering these different services so service offerings are there sohow the price is going to be like so this is the optimal pricingso first we will talk about the optimal composition of virtual sensors so this particular youknow if you are interested to look further into the details of this this is a paper alongwith one of my students we have you know this was published in i triple e internationalconference on communications in two thousand fifteen so optimal composition of sensor ahvirtual sensors so let us consider two different scenarios like this of sensor cloud in onescenario let us say we have we have these different sensors that are deployed and thesesensors finally have to be virtualized right virtualized so how many virtual instancesare we going to create how many virtual instance are going to be create and what are theseinstances it is not going to be like you know one physical sensor to one virtual sensoryou now it is not like one to one mapping between these physical sensors and virtualsensors so we could have these are like few virtual sensors that are created and correspondingto this one we have ah this physical sensor we have this virtual instance we could beeven be having something like this or even we could have something like thisso this kind of mapping is possible is possible so any way so that keeping apart that particularissue so you know how which sensors which physical sensors or corresponding to whichphysical sensors which virtual sensors are going to be or how these virtual sensors aregoing to be grouped along among themselves for a particular application on top so letus say how we are going to group them to serve a particular application on top so that isone issue and here we are considering that these sensors are physically located in aparticular geographical locationso all these sensors are in one geographical location now it might so happen that in realscenarios it might so happen that we have different geographical locations and in thesedifferent geographical locations we have first of all different sensors in different geographicallocations and the same thing has to be done over here is virtualization and the compositionof these virtual sensors so what is going to happen here again we are going to havefew of these so this mapping has to be done and you know these particular sense ah ina virtual instance might be mapped with two different physical sensors in two differentgeographical area or it could even be something like these or these and these and somethinglike thatso two things have to be taken here of a particular virtual instance corresponds to which physicalsensors in a particular geographical location or across different geographical locationsnumber one and number two is how do you how do you group these different virtual sensorstogether in order to serve a particular application in order to serve a particular applicationso this is the whole problem a very fundamental problem to do with the deployment of sensorcloud so optimal composition of virtual sensors the detail paper i i set is available overhere so efficient virtualization of the physical sensor nodes is one problem then how do youoptimally compose this virtual sensors the how do you put them together how do you groupthem together so for this again if all these sensors are located in the same geographica region you have one kind of scheme and if it is spanning across multiple regions youhave a different schemeso why composition of the virtual sensors because the sensors are inherently resourceconstraint energy constraint communication constraint computation constraint and so ondynamic change in sensor conditions also exist to the sensors we are changing dynamicallynot only their duty cycle the energy resources etcetera etcetera their status they changedynamically not only that but also the physical conditions around them also change the sensorconditions consequently will also change additionally it might so happen that some sensors theyare you know they due to some hardware or software failure they fail operate and thatis why they do not you know at one instance of time they are operating but at the verynext instance they may not be operatingso we have all these different types of different types of changes that are possible in thesekind of networks the composition of the virtual sensors are nontraditional you know so soyou know if we talk about traditionally what is going to happen let us say we have thisinfrastructure as a service software as a service you know each of these so let us seeinfrastructure as a service or like software as a service so what they are dealing withis just one kind of virtualization virtualization of only one type whether if the virtualizationof software virtualization of infrastructure and so on but over here we have a differentscenario here we are talking about virtualization of different different things different typesdifferent types has to be virtualized so it is bit different over hereso the formation of virtual sensors as i tell you before if all these different sensorsare located or collocated not only collocated but also may be in the same geographic locationthey could be virtualized and these virtual composition virtual virtual sensor could beformed out of a subset of the physical sensors in this particular manner and in this particularscenario it is considered that for optimal composition we have at the physical levelwe are homogenous sensor nodes the sensor nodes they all have their own you know differentspecifications not not different specifications but the same specification they all have theirown same specification and you know you group them together in order to form the virtualsensor node and in this particular scenario we have the virtual sensor groups differentlocations geographical locations having different sensors and as you can over here through thesedifferent labels they have not labels but this different we have these ah ah you knowwe have these different colored sensors ah denoting different types of sensors in specificationin types types means you know temperature sensor humidity sensor these are differenttypesso ah you know temperature sensor ah you know pressure sensor um camera sensor these aredifferent types of sensors so you know in this particular formulation they have consideredwe have considered that not only that the sensors are geographically distributed theirsgeographical separated from each other but they also they also ah you know they can becomposed they are heterogeneous and they can be composed in this particular fashion soyou can have a virtual sensor which is comprised of or it is mapped to the physical sensorsin one geographical location and some other physical sensors in another geographical locationsome other physical sensor in a third geographical location some other physical sensor in a fourthgeographical locationso these all will be taken together they may not necessary be one and the same see theymay not be of the same that is that is they may not all be of the temperature sensor theycould be you know temperature sensor along with pressure sensor you know temperaturesensor in one location pressure sensor in one location so on they all can be put togetherand clap together abstract it together as a virtual sensor as a virtual sensor so wehave likewise different other virtual sensors formed together and these virtual sensorsadd another higher level can be put together and grouped together to form virtual sensorgroups so or example vs one and vs two can be grouped together to form a virtual sensorgroup or vs two and vs three could be you know group together to form virtual sensorgroup in this particular example we see that a particular virtual sensor group is formedout of these three vss the vss vs one vs two and vs threeso remember one thing one thing that unlike the previous formulation here we had consideredhomogenous sensors at the physical level and here we have considered heterogeneous sensorson top of the fact that they could be all ah you know they could be geographically dispersedthey may not all be in the same geographic location different sensors from differentgeographic locations can be mapped together to form virtual sensors at the higher levelof abstraction and these different virtual sensors again can be club together to formvirtual sensor groupsso in terms of the performance you know when we talked about cov one and cov two correspondingto the composition of the virtual sensors in the homogenous and the heterogeneous geographicallydistributed ah a manners as we spoke about in the previous two ah previous two slidesso we have you know if we look at the comparison of performance with respect to the energyconsumption so because this is cumulative energy consumption for pc over here is covone this is the plot for cov one and this is the plot for cov two so as we can see overhere that the energy consumption basically steadily increases in each of these and quiteunderstandably that cov two basically in curse greater energy consumption compared to covone and in terms of the life time this is a comparison of the lifetime for each of thesetwo scenarios as we can see over here that the red colored one is for cov two and thegreen colored ah labels are for cov oneso life time on the other hand increases not other hand but lifetime basically increasesif we have the homogenous sensor scenario where the sensors are from one geographiclocation and they all have the same specification so we have ah these two different scenariosof cumulative energy consumption and network life time and the comparisons between covone and cov two and as i said before if you are interested to look further into theseyou may refer to this particular paper the optimal composition of a virtual sensor nodefor efficient virtualization with in sensor cloud this is a paper that ah ah you knowwas published by us in the i triple e cc icc conference ah that was ah in two thousandfifteen in london then we come to the second problem which is the dynamic and adaptivedata caching mechanism so before i go to the details of it i would like to give you a fewexamples let us say we are talking about environment monitoring with the help of different typesof sensors including temperature sensornow in an in a particular area the temperature doesnt change too frequently so it is unnecessaryto always collect data from the different sensors at very frequent intervance it isunnecessary and similarly it is also unnecessary to make the corresponding virtual sensorsavailable to the end users to different end users so it is sufficient if the temperaturevalues are connected and are cached and are stored and we made available to the differentusers whenever they need access to that information it is not required to create a virtual instanceand then have that virtual through that virtual instance collect or prime that particularsensor to collect the data to make that sensor in a sense and collect the data at you knowconsecutive instances of time at subsequent intervals of time by different usersso it is required to cache so there are likewise different scenarios different applicationswhere this is required to cache so we will look at the different ways to cache so basicallythis caching basically introduces two different types of cache one is the internal cache theother one is the external cache so this example that i was giving you was about that externalcache will to look at the internal cache shortly so this caching mechanism basically ensuresefficiency in resource utilizationso ah caching basically is flexible ah with the varied rate of change of the physicalenvironment so why caching is required in sensor cloud because end users request forthe sensed information through a web interface and the allocation of the physical sensornodes and virtualization takes place and the physical sensor nodes continuously sends andtransmit the data to the sensor cloud and that is the reason why you know it is notalways required to you know prime and probe the sensors ah ah to sense and continuouslysend the sensed data though the web interface two different end usersso practical in some cases the change in environmental conditions are significantly slow like inthe case of temperature change or humidity change and so on so they are not very fastso it is not required to always sense through the physical sensors so the even if you senseit will give you merely the same value the physical sensors are not going to give vastlydifferent values so they remain physically unaltered the slow due to the slow changein the environment the readings are going to be unalteredso in such a situation it is unnecessary to sense because the sensing would again unnecessarilyconsume energy which is undesirable so we introduce the concept of internal cache andexternal cache who i am talk i will i am going to talk about these two but before i proceedfurther i would like to ah give you the reference for it this particular paper while publishedby us if you need more details about this internal and external cache and how this cachingmechanism operates you can go through this particular paper the reference of which isgiven over here at the very bottom of this slide and this was published in the i triplee conference in two thousand fourteen and ah so so let is now go back and try to understandwhat is the difference between the internal cache and the external cacheso the internal cache basically handles the request from the end users takes decisionwhether the data should be provided directly to the end user or is it required to re cachethe data from the external cache and what is this external cache so it is a separatepiece of server or hardware which at every certain interval of time it collects the dataand stores inside it so initially few data are used to transmit to the internal cacheso this is the architecture of caching so this is the existing architecture and thisis the case cache enabled architecture on the left we have this existing architectureso where we had these different physical sensors and this is that sensor cloud and these appsare getting access to that to the sensors through the sensor cloud through resourcepooling mechanismsnow in the cache enabled architecture we have this internal cache and the external cacheexternal cache could be conceptualize something like a separate server which is outside thecloud where the data that are made available to the end users through these apps are alsocached at the same time at this in this server in this external cache and so you know itmight so happen that periodically at different instances instances of time it is not requiredto prove that physical level sensor again so you know the data if it is not very muchstale it could be fetched from this particular external cache and if you it could be doneeven better it might so happen that these different virtual instances that are in thesensor cloud here the data might be also available may be one user is already using it and thatdata could be made available because if you have to fetch it outside the cloud that isgoing to increase the time for fetching and so you want to keep something over here aswellso this is these internal cache and this is how it differs from the external cache soexternal cache is an external server kind of thing however internal cache is residentinside the cloud inside the sensor cloud and this is how it differs from the external cachehere is the comparison of performance ah between the caching mechanism ah you know using internaland external caching mechanisms ah and in the conventional mechanism like as i showedthe conventional means this this is that existing conventional mechanism and caching based mechanismmeans this particular mechanism and is a ah here what we see is the performance comparisonbetween the twoso ah in terms of ah let us say the total the total ah ah you know ah cost total energyconsumption so total energy consumption in the case of the conventional mechanism thatmeans without using the caching mechanism is shown over here in this particular pinkcolored plot whereas the total energy consumption using caching is shown in this particularpurple color plot so as you can see over here that the total energy consumption decreasesquite significantly if we are using the caching mechanism as shown in this particular figureand how it compares with this pink colored plot in terms of the network life time hereis the conventional scenario and here is the scenario of using caching so as you can seeover here conventionally the network lifetime is much more reduced and if we are using cachingthe lifetime basically improves a lotso it is quite significant in terms of the difference between using caching and withoutcaching mechanism so caching basically improves overall network life time and finally i wouldlike to talk about another issue of sensor cloud again this is taken from a paper thatwe have published in the i triple e transactions on services computing in two thousand seventeenand here we have ticked into the issue of pricing in sensor cloud and how we can comeup with an optimal pricing mechanism in a sensor cloud scenario where that pricing mechanismitself is not only optimal but dynamic in nature so the pricing itself is dynamic sohow does it happen so we will talk about thatso if we look at the existing cloud where iaas saas paas models are used there you aretalking about homogeneity of services so existing pricing schemes in the cloud the regular cloudare talking about homogenous services whether it is a saas service the paas service or iaasservice and there is no scheme for pricing for sensors as a service that means this particularsensor cloud scenario sensors as a service c as scenario so we have proposed a pricingmechanism that comprises of two components one is the pricing that is attributed to thehardware that means the sensor and the pricing that is attributed to the infrastructure thatmeans the other infrastructure that are that are in place the operating system the otherhardware infrastructure the switches the ah the the servers and so onso pricing attributed to the hardware which is for hardware like sensors and the pricingattributed to infrastructure so ph and pi so the goal of the proposed pricing schemeis to maximize the profit of the sensor cloud service provider maximize the profit of thesensor owner and to maximize the satisfaction of the end users so if we look at this scenariowe have this different end users now you see that what might so happen if the sensing hasstarted from particular point so to the sinks sink when it travels in sensor networks insensor networks the sensor data from the source to the sink it travels via different intermediatehops via different intermediate hops and these hops could be belonging to different sensorowners in this particular mannerso when you talk about a pricing mechanism we have to take into consideration the pricingdue to the hardware cost belonging to different sensor owners in addition to the sensor costof the specific owner from where the sensor sensing has taken place of the sensor fromthe sensor so this sensor data is made a made available through the base station to thesensor cloud and is made accessible to the end users so end users will not only haveto pay for the hardware cost of these sensor that means the source sensor but also thehardware cost of these sensors plus also hardware cost not hardware cost but the infrastructurecost of other types of infrastructure that are in place like the base station the theservers ah the switches and so on so all these also have to contribute towards the priceso how do we come up with a pricing mechanism negotiation is the scenario where the pricescan also be negotiated so this may not happen in all different cases but in some cases itmight so happen that the end users would be able to bargain and be able to negotiate theprice with the sensor owners or ah with the sensor cloud service provider so there wouldbe some kind of a bargaining mechanism in place it will be a market place kind of scenarioa oligor oligopolistic market place scenario where this kind of bargaining can take placeso the focus is on maximizing the profit that is made by the sensor cloud service provideroptimal pricing to the end users increasing the satisfaction of the end users by consideringdifferent factors all the above three by considering different factors such as the pricing thatis attributed to the hardware while dealing with the usage of the physical sensor nodespricing attributed to the infrastructure by dealing with the prices associated with theinfrastructure of the sensor cloudso these are some of these different issues and the least of different references if youare interested to know further about sensor cloud the different works on sensor cloudhere are few references for you as you see over here in our group in the swan lab wehave ah a done ah bit of ah a digging ah into the depth of sensor cloud sensor sensor asa service virtualization of sensors composition of sensors caching of different sensors andso on so these are different things that we have done in one of the papers i will tellyou that this particular paper also talks about a comparison between a side by sidecomparison a quantitative comparison between sensor cloud and the traditional sensor networksso with this we come to an end of sensor cloud sensor cloud is a very important technologyat present for enabling sensor networks sorry ah for enabling internet of things and internetof things basically you know ah if you think little bit deep can be made efficient theimplementation of ah internet of things can be made efficient if we are talking aboutsensor cloud and sensor cloud has some similarities with in concept with the fog computing andcloud computing that also has been covered in the different literature and this is foryou to try to understand that what is the difference between sensor cloud fog computingand regular cloud computing this is all to do with efficiency you know ah access to differentservices you know these are with respect to these things basically they differ a lot andah we know it is not like sens[or]- if sensor cloud is there we do not need cloud it isnot like that and also it is not like that if sensor cloud is there we do not need fogso we need all these three ah three things ah at different times you know there are usefulfor different scenarios so we need all of them to together so all of these technologiesare required to build internet of things thank you
