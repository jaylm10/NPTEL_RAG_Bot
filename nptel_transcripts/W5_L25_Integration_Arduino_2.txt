hello now after completing the integration of various sensors with arduino and we havecompleted integration of basic actuators like lights leds and the external leds inbuiltleds so we will now in this lecture we will now move on to integration of ah a motor basedactuator so over here i have got a small servo motor so this one particularly is use forcontrolling the wings and tail adders of remote control planes or rc planes see so this isjust a there is a geared mechanism inside i don't know whether it is visible or notso there is a motor and you when you send pulses of various widths the motor rotatesto just that bit so there are various gears inside okso in this lecture we will learn how to integrate this motors and make it perform accordingto our requirements so here we are going to cover the following topics introduction toactuators ah servo motors and interfacing of this servo motor with arduino so will firstdeal with hardware interface and then the actual sketch we are going to which you aregoing to upload on the hardware so actuators are basically mechanical or electro mechanicaldevices they convert energy or signals into motion and mainly use to provide controlledmotion to other components of various mechanical structures or devisorsso basic working principle is ah in the servo motor you have various mechanical structureslike gears and screws and ball bearings which ah interfaced with a small motor over hereand this produces very control motion but is able to ah perform much more ah efficientlythen this motor alone would have been able to so like generally for servers the top requirementsare high as compared to normal dc motors so this is what is ah known as ah micro servoin the market so while purchasing you look for micro servo motors there are servo motorsof various ranges and sizes so this one is this can be directly integrated with our arduinoboard without much ah interfacing or external circuitryso we have various types of motor based actuators actually ah servo motor is just one of themyou have servo motors stepper motors hydraulic motors solenoid relays ac motors ah one pointto note here is solenoid and relays are not actually motor based actuators but sometimessolenoid may be used to drive motors and relays may be used to integrate various multiplemotors with any kind of programmable circuit so relay is something like a electro mechanicalswitch where as solenoid works on the principle of ah magnetism ah whenever you pass thereis a coil there is a coil surrounding an iron coal whenever you pass current through thecoil the whole set of magnetizes ah you can use it as a magnetso various uses of solenoid and solenoid walls ah for controlling water in pipes electroniclocks and so on so will focus only on the servo motor part so it is a high precisionmotor and it is able to provide a rotary motion between zero and one eighty degrees and asyou have seen it has got three wires one black one red and one yellow so many are times youmay have you may see that the black wire may be replace with brown ones also so the motori have got doesnt have a black wire but it has got a brown wire but nothing to worryabout this darkest wire is actually kept for browned then red one is for the power supplyi am actually going to provide five volt power supply from the arduino board and the yellowone is the signal pin which is going to provide the signal for control motion to the motornot from the motor to the device it is going to provide signals from the board to the motorso at again we have to install a special library so following the process we follow duringthe dht library installation just have to ah update your library if not already updatedto include the servo library and within the sketch we have to create ah instance calledservo servo myservo for enabling this use of this particular servo so before movingany further let us just take a look in the library will just search for servo over onthe library manager as you can see there are many options for servos but i have just choosingthe adafruit pwm servo driver library so its already installedso nothing else to worry about and one more thing when you install a new library you cansee whatever examples you had package with the normal id when you first downloaded itso whatever library is you install you get some sample demo programs so for this adafruitpwm servo driver library we have something called a pwm test and we are something calledservo so we click on it a new sketch will appear so this is a what we called ah companyprovided sketch just you check whether your code is working whether your hardware is workingfine or not whether there is any problem with your board or whether there is any problemwith your motor or other such thingsso its a pretty big code we actually will be ah doing something very simple not thiscomplicated so will take a look at the code now again we include the servo dot h libraryfunction library file so once this has been included here we are choosing a servo pinas the pin number twelve on the at mega board then instance of a we create a instance ofthe servo as servo demo then within the setup we write servodemo dot attach these are someof the functions associated with servodemo so within attach it would expect the pin numberto which the servo is being attached the pin number of the processor board your using orthe arduino board you are usingso ones this setup is done we move on to the looping function so you have servodemo theinstance of the servo servodemo dot write if we write zero it will move zero degreesit it it reposition itself to zero degrees then we put a delay for thousand millisecondsor one second then we again write ah value as ninety to move the servo ninety degreesagain a delay of one second again after this we try to move the servo to one eighty degreesso ah if you recall in the previous slides i have said the servo the servo is able tomove between zero and one eighty degree so this is the code out lineso we have already covered these what will go through it create an instance of the servothe instance should be attached to the pin before it can be used in the code then ahthat means within setup you write that servo instance dot attach and the pin number ifyou just call that servo instance dot write it will not function you have to actuallyattach the servo with the coding part then the write function takes the degree valuesand rotates the motor accordingly a connection is pretty simple connect the ground of theservo that is the dark wire to the ground on the arduino board we connect the powersupply wire that is generally the red wire to the five volt pin on the board and signalwire to anyone of the pins ah we may used pin eight or pin twelve or any kind of digitalinput output pins now try to using the board we connect theboard to the pc we set the port number and the board type we verify and then upload thecode so the code we just discuss few slides back it will give you an output of first willturn zero degree it will a line itself to zero degree then it will wait for one secondthen will go to ninety degrees then wait for one second and finally it will go to one eightydegrees and this thing will keep on looping over and over again so will see a few variationsof this code so there are lot more functions with the servo library we have we have a knobfunction we have a sweep function write write microseconds read attached detach and so onso now focusing back to the ideso the code we discuss just now is already open so we have set the servo pin as pin eightor may be any one of the pins we can set let us say we set it to pin twelve or pin tenright now before we do anything will connect the servo so we connect the ground wire brownor black wire to the ground pin on the board then we connect the vcc to the power supplypin on the board and finally will use a wire of another color yes so finally we attachthe signal the yellow wire so we are about to set it to pin ten so will attach it topin number ten so thats itso this is the connection of the servo we attached the board to the pcnow we check of processor is at mega two five six zero ah always verify ah we have variousah variations of at mega board as you can see on the board over here this is arduinomega two five six zero if is zoom in on this regionthis is at mega two five six zero its always better to be carefulso you see there are two variations at mega two five six zero and at mega one two eightzero so we are selected two five six zero the port has been selected we verify our codeso this seems to be no error in the code now we upload our code now if you focus on themotor i will reset it it will first align itself to zero then ninety then one eightynow we can try different variations of this code is take out the output ah single pinso suppose the id instead of zero ninety and one eighty we give forty five forty five andforty five so let see what it doesso it doesnt seem to be doing anything so will try a different variation we give itzero we give it ninety we give it ninety so it seems we have hit upon some error asyou can see it shows do time out that is the compiler time out so will again check whatis wrong with it lets reverse back to the original codeports asset board asset ok this something wrong with this this thing is permanentlyyellow will do one think we restart the code so we again compile the codeand upload the code so there are various other functions we can try with the servo we haveah knob sweep write so its actually ah up to the user how you can manipulate these functionsthese libraries to build a new application so i hope you enjoy building ah iot serviceswhich arduino boards just integrate simple senses and integrate them in various innovative ways thank you
