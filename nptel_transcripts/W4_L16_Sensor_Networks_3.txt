in this lecture i am going to talk about some of the applications of sensor networks sosensor networks as i said in a previous lecture can be used for serving different applicationsagriculture healthcare space and so on and so forth many different types of applicationsare possible so we will take up few of the applications where sensor networks can beused and also keeping in mind some of the research works that we have done in our swenlab at iit kharagpur and ah so so that i can give you a little bit of more insight aboutyou know house sensor networks can be used to address different problems of differentapplication domainsso the first thing that i am going to talk about is the problem of target tracking solet me explain to you what the problem of target tracking is so let us say target trackingthis is also known as object tracking so what happens is sensor networks are verymuch useful for surveillance applications surveillance applications means that ah wecan use different types of sensors we can use cameras we can use a combination of allof these sensors cameras etcetera etcetera to track a particular object a particulartarget maybe there is some suspicious activity that is going on maybe in a public place likea railway station or maybe in a crowded place some plaza or some ah market place or somethinglike thatso sensor networks can be used for surveillance application so if there is already some sensorinfrastructure that is deployed in a particular place so these sensors can be used to to firstof all identify that there is something wrong that is going on so you need to have appropriatesensors of course and thereafter once it is detected that there is some suspicious activitythat is going on then to track the trajectory of the target so this tracking can be of twoforms one is that as and when the target moves we keep onwe keep on ah ah following the target using these different sensors we keep on sensingwhere and how the target is movingso that can be done in real time the other possibility is that to predict the trajectoryof the target so predicting the trajectory of the target so it can be of two types nowwhat essentially i in either of these cases what essentially happens is we have differentsensor nodes these sensor nodes are placed all over in the terrain where monitoring hasto be done now let us say that there is an object maybe a human that has been detectedby these sensors these three sensors this one this one and this one so the problem oftrajectory ah sorry target tracking is that when this target moves the trajectory of thatparticular target has to be followed by these different sensors on the way so this is whatthis is this particular problemthe second problem is to predict the trajectory so prediction means that let us say that thisobject has been identified here in this particular position by these sensors it moves to thenext location the next location is let us say here and then these sensors have detectedthis particular target like this it keeps on moving etcetera etcetera it comes to thisparticular position and then at this position we have to predict that what is going to bethe next particular position or a sequence of positions of the target so we have to predictthe next position or sequence of positions of this target so this is known as the problemof target tracking in sensor networksso going back ah we have different types of formulations of the problem of target trackingone is the push based formulation which is about that nodes computing the position ofthe target and periodically notifying the sink node so you know if this is a sensornetwork deployment then you know this particular target this object has been identified bythese sensors have been sensed by these sensors and then these sensors when this object movesit is going to compute the position of the target and then periodically at certain intervalsof time notify to the sink node in this case let us say that this is the sink node so itwill be modified to this particular sink nodeso sink node is the one which basically gets all the data from the other other nodes thesource nodes and the intermediate relay nodes so this is the sink node leadership now theother formulation is known as the poll based formulation which is shown in the second figureover here so in this particular formulation what we have is nodes registering the presenceof the target to permit a low cost query so in other words the nodes are going to sendout are going to poll all the all the other nodes to see if there is any object that isthere in their locality that means within their sensing range so this is the poll basedso it is going to periodically it is going to polledso every node is going to be polled periodically and the third is where there is a trackerthat is used so tracker basically follows the trail of the target and intercepts thetarget so this is known as a guided formulation ok so we have three distinct types of formulationof the problem of target tracking in sensor networks the next point that i would alsolike to highlight is that targeting is actually very important for sensor networks targettracking applications like surveillance etcetera etcetera are very attractive and that is whythere has been lot of research on target tracking or object tracking in sensor networks lotof research in our research group also we have done a lot of work on target trackingand ah so if you are interested you know you can visit my website and can get access tothese papers research papers but without getting into the research details let me also highlightanother particular aspectso let us say that we have going back we have a terrain like this so in this particularterrain in the previous example i had considered that there is a single target or single objectthis human like this there could be other objects as well and this is quite naturalor this is quite typical in most of these applications because normally you are notgoing to track a single object normally it is going to be like there are multiple objectsso tracking multiple objects is it even more difficult problem then single object trackingmulti object tracking is even more a difficult problem than multi objective and that is quiteobvious i do not need to really elaborate am about why it is so so this multi objecttracking one way is that individually you keep on tracking all the other objects aswell but that is not efficient so the problem is that how to efficiently efficiently howto track multiple objects in a terrain ok so now let us move to the second ah secondslide where we have to understand how this target tracking basically functionsso first let us say that you know we have different sensor nodes this ah the sensornodes they have a an object in their position in the a a close to them in their sensingrange now what has to happen is the different nodes have to do lot of cooperation for differentpurposes maybe for aggregating the data maybe for ah relaying the information that has beenreceived about the tracking from other nodes who have actually detected the presence ofthe target or who are following the target and so on and so forth so like this lot ofdifferent types of cooperation has to happenand then what happens is the position the exact position of the target has to be computedand this can be done using different ways the position computation can be done in differentways for example using the concept of trilateration using the concept of trilateration if we knowthe positions of these three different sensor nodes we can easily compute the position ofthis particular object which is within the sensing range of these three then after thatthere has to be some predic prediction that has to happen so prediction is about thatif the object is at a particular location at this pat at a certain instant of time thenat the later instant of time after delta t time let us say where the object is goingto be so let us say that the object is going to be over hereso this particular position position has to be predicted and thereafter issues such asenergy management etcetera etcetera have to be taken care of because it should not happenthat large number of sensors basically are activated and they all start sensing so whatis the minimum number of sensors that are required in order to efficiently track thetarget first of all identify the position of the target and then track it so activatingthose sensor nodes and those few sensor nodes and basically putting the other nodes to thesleep mode which is basically a low resource consuming low energy consuming mode of thesensor nodesso this is another energy management problem that also has to be addressed alongside theproblem of target tracking so i told you about the problem of target tracking like this sensornetworks can be used for various other applications as well it has indeed been used in our researchgroup apart from different other applications we have particularly focused on the use ofsensor networks in agriculture so in agriculture we have basically focused on number one surveillanceof agricultural field so this is basically agriculture agricultural applications we havealso done some work on the use of sensor networks in the agricultural field for monitoring thesoil parameters the soil parameters so for example moisture content water level contentand many other parameters for example the mineral content of the soil phosphorus nitrogenand so on so these can also be sensed so soil moisture water level etc they can be usedthey can be sensed and that information can be used for irrigating irrigation irrigationof the field so if the soil moisture of the particular field has gone down we can irrigatethe field and so on ok so like this actually there are different types of applicationsin surveillance we have worked on ah monitoring if a particular agricultural field is protectedfrom intrusions from intrusions from let us say cattle ah like ah you know cows goatsetcetera etcetera because normally you know this is a very typical problem in a countrylike india where we have ah different cattles and different animals getting into the fielddamaging the cropsand so on so this kind of surveillance of the field is also very much required so sothis kind of intrusions have to be detected and this can be done with the help of thistechnology the system that we have developed which is known as the aid so aid is basicallya prototype for agricultural intrusion detection using wireless sensor networks we are usingtwo types of sensors the passive in infrared sensor the pir sensor and the ultrasonic sensorso when an intruder basically enters the field through the boundary of the field the pirsensor detects the object that means the intruder and the ultrasonic sensor basically sensesthe distance at which the object is locatedso this is why these two different sensors are used there is sensor whether it has theentered or not and the ultrasonic sensor about how far the object is from that particularsensor so this is the schematic diagram so this is the agricultural field and an intrudergetting in these different sensors are deployed in the perimeter or the boundary and the sensorswill detect whether there is any intrusion that is going on or not and if it is goingon then the farmer is going to be notified through cell phone or through other meansat his home or wherever he is this is the layered architecture of this particular systemthat we have developed so first two layers are sensing using pir sensor and the ultrasonicsensorand then processing by the microcontroller and then routing and finally the applicationlevel sms and alert messages will be sent to the to the farmer or any other stakeholderof that particular field so this is one application that we study the second definitely the firstis basically target tracking second is agriculture and in agriculture what we have just gonethrough is detecting intrusions in agricultural field we could as i told you also that wecould use sensors different types of sensors to to measure to monitor the soil conditionswith respect to moisture content water level content and so on and so forth and ah correspondinglyif let us say the soil parameters have gone down or is below a certain desired level thenthe field is going to be irrigated now let us look at something known as the multimediasensor networks multimedia sensor networks is very interesting in the media sensor networkswe use multimedia devices apart from the regular sensors these regular sensors like temperaturesensor humidity sensor soil moisture sensor etcetera etcetera these in multimedia sensornetwork technology in the community is known as scalar sensors these sensors are knownas scalar sensors and in addition we have the camera sensors the camera sensors basicallyinclude like steel cameras in the small sized steel cameras or video cameras which can beintegrated along with these scalars scalar sensors to get a complete picture of whatis going on in a particular area of interestso typically what would happen is we would be very much interested to get a completepicture and for getting complete picture ideally we should have cameras everywhere which wouldtake still images and so on but that basically is not only expensive having too many camerasdeploying too many cameras in a field is not only expensive but also that is not a verygood solution from a network point of view because if we have too many images of bigsize being taken then these big images big sized images are going to float all over inthe network and that is going to be not a very good solution for a resource constrainedmore specifically a bandwidth constrained environment like a sensor networkso the whole idea is can we use large number of these inexpensive cheap low cost sensorscalar sensors and have a fewer camera sensors and together we can we have a better surveillanceso how it is going to happen i will show you so let us say that we have some terrain ofinterest so here we can have these different scale sensors all over which can be somethinglike temperature sensor humidity sensor soil moisture sensor or whatever depending on theapplication that we are targeting and within this we would be usingso these are the green colored circles basically denote the scalar sensors and then we wouldbe using only very few cameras so these cameras are expensive so we cannot use too many ofthem and also from a network perspective as i said before we cannot use too many camerasso so so what is going to happen first these cameras these scalar cam sorryah these scalar sensors they are going to detect whether there is something going onor not and thereafter if indeed there is something some suspicious activity or something goingon and is detected by these scalar sensors through their collaborative sensing then thesesensors are going to activate the camera and this camera is then going to servilewhat exactly precisely is going on similarly the other cameras could also be activateddepending on the position of the particular object and how it is moving in the particularfield so this is how the camera and scalar sensors putting together can work collaborativelyyou know wireless multimedia sensor network so there are different applications of multimediasensor networks surveillance is something that i was talking about rightnow but we can also have wild habitat monitoring like you know wild habitat monitoring meanslike ah you can have these multimedia sensor networks to track precisely and monitor howthe different wild animals in their natural habitat are moving how what activities theyare doing whether they are healthy or not and so on and so forth environmental monitoringlikewise and so on so like this actually there are different types of applications of multimediasensor networks topology management is another very interesting ah problem in topology managementwhat happens is that in the presence of these different sensors and in our particular casewe are talking about multimedia sensors in the presence of these multimedia sensor networksand these different sensors how the topology is going to be maintainedover time how these sensors are going to connect with one another over time whether they areyou know whether with respect to coverage coverage means that with ah different sensorswhether the entire region of interest is covered by at least one sensor or not so with respectto coverage and connectivity connectivity means that from every sensor whether thereis connectivity to the sink node or not so with respect to coverage and connectivitywhether at different instants of time the network is ah has a healthy topology so thisis what is taking care of in the problem of topology management and this is this is onepaper that is there for you as a source which you can go through to understand the problemof topology management in sensor networks another application and a technology thathas evolved over time is nano networks you must have already heard about lot of interestin nano structures nano materials nano devices and so on and in including nano sensors butyou may not have heard about nano networksso narrow networks more specifically nano sensor networks can be of two types one isthe electromagnetic nano sensor networks the other one is the bio nano sensor networksso the electromagnetic nano sensor networks basically as the name suggests the communicationis through electromagnetic ah ah means and the other one is by nano sensor networks wherebasically it is biomolecules that help in communication in the human body or any humanah or you know any other natural being so ah nano devices are used for as nodes in anano network on a nano sensor network and every nano device has different componentslike one of which is the nano sensor nano actuator nano power device and so on and soforth so this is how the communication takes place and between the source and source deviceand the sink there is going to be over the nano medium such as carbon nanotubes thereis going to be flow of charges that is going to take place and as you can see over herethis is in the scale of few nanometers only so as you can understand one issue over hereis to first design or fabricate nano sensors similarly it is also required to design andfabricate other nano devices like nano actuators nano power sources and so on and then theother problem is how we can put the nano sensors nano actuators nano power devicesand the like together as a single device then nano node and this nano node also has a nanocommunication unit and this communication unit of one nano node would help to connectwith another ah ah nano node with a similar kind of receiving device and this communicationin nano electromagnetic networks takes place ah ah ah in the terahertz band so this istypically this communication takes place in the period spent in nano networks so thisis what i was telling you this is a schematic of how a nano node looks like so we have thisnano power unit we have this nano sensors actuators nano memory nano processor nanoantennas for communication and so on and these corresponding dimensions are also mentionedover here so this is like one micrometer two micrometer six micrometers and so on so thisis this is a very small kind of you know extremely small scale nano scale node which has to befabricated not using conventional sensor node design mechanisms but using a very sophisticatedmechanism that is ah ah that takes help of nano fabrication ah units nano fab fabricationfacilitiesso earlier i was talking about this nano electromagnetic communication i also mentioned that bio nanonetworks are possible where the communication takes place through molecular exchange soinformation in this kind of a bio nano networks is basically packed into something known asthe vesicles and the gap junction works as a mediator between the cells and the vesiclesand the information is exchanged between the communication entities using the moleculesso in the electromagnetic communication something like this happens you know it is basicallyelectromagnetic waves that basically are passed through some kind of nano material like agraphene or something like that and the information is transferred from one device to anotherdeviceso great magnetic communication for nano network centers around the point one to ten terahertzgeneral band then we have underwater acoustic sensor networks where basically it is aboutsubmerging conceptually submerging the sensor nodes that we are familiar with so far inthe underwater domain submerging them let us say in the ocean and then having them senseand communicate to retrieve the information from under the surface of water so this conceptuallyis very simple and is similar to what happens in the terrestrial sensor network domainhowever in practice achieving and underwater sensor network fabricating a underwater sensornode and then connecting those nodes to communicate underwater to sense and communicate underwateris a hugely challenging task and there are so many different challenges that have tobe taken into account the first thing is the mobility the mobility because of waves andcurrents underwater the nodes wants to deploy them at a particular point they are not goingto maintain their position subsequently they are going to move all aroundso how do you maintain the topology of the network in the first place second thing isthat with respect to communication when these different waves are are hitting these differentnodes then they are also affecting the communication channel the channel are is also going to beaffected so in such kind of noisy environment how the communication is going to take placealso in addition we have the medium which is typically like saline in nature where thereis lot of temperature very in the ocean column where there is lot of pressure variation inthat ocean column so all these also affect the communication channel and the performanceof communication in such environments so different oceanic forces also have impact on these networksand that is the reason trying to simulate trying to simulate an underwater sensor networkand its environment is not very easy so one of the important concerns about simulationis that how the nodes in an underwater sensor network are going to moveso for that there is a mobility model that has been proposed and this is known as theah there are different mobility models one of which is the meandering current mobilitymodel so this meandering current mobility model was proposed in a paper that was publishedin infocom conference several years back and thereafter we have proposed in our group amobility model which is known as the of mm oceanic forces model mobility model and thecharacteristic of this particular of mm mobility model is that we have taken into account therealistic forces that are going to hit a particular node in a in an oceanic environment whereasthe meandering current mobility model that do not take all these different forcesthat we have considered and this is how we have come up with this ofmm mobility modeland this can be used to simulate the behavior of underwater sensor networkslocalization is another problem localization problem is concerned about that how to localizethe different nodes in the network and as i said that underwater environments highlydynamic highly chaotic and localizing the position of the different nodes is highlychallenging as well and there are again lot of works that have been conducted on thisparticular problem so it is important to predict how the different nodes are going to moveat different points of time accurately so accurately finding out that at a particularinstant of time in the future where this node is going to be is a challenging problem oflocalization in underwater sensor networksprotocols such as hasl which use beacon sending beacon reception and location estimation informationto basically localize the nodes so these are these start with first getting some gps coordinatefrom maybe a surface sink and then start processes like dead recording and broadcast becomingsorry ah broadcasting beacons and so on receiving the beacons getting an estimate of locationestimation through processes such as trilateration and so on and this has been explained in detailin this particular paper that is referenced over here at the bottom of the slideso dead reckoning i was mentioning to you about dead reckoning digitally is i mean itis a technique of localization that is typically used in oceanic environments where it is hardto find specific references so in dead reckoning what is done is based on the distance froma particular target or a particular node whose position is known it is estimated how anothernode how much far another node is located and at what angleso based on this distance and angular information the position of the target at different instanceof time in a marine environment is basically computed this is a proposal you know thisis a paper ah ah ah i triple e transactions on mobile computing it appeared and here basicallyyou know we are talking about how to efficiently localize with the help of advanced techniquessuch as game theory and so onso here we have considered two types of nodes that are localized nodes and the localizednodes the problem is about based on the location information from the localized nodes how toget the location information of the unlocalized nodes and for this what we do is we we varythe the communication range the transmission range of the of the of the nodes and by varyingit the problem is to maximize the number of varying or increasing the the increasing thetransmission range the problem is to maximize the number of nodes other nodes which canbe put within that corresponding range the transmission range of a particular node sothis is what is shown over here pictorially as you can see this particular node you knowit has an initial communication range like this the transmission range which can be increasedfurther like these other circlesso these are the three different ranges that are shown of the communication range or thetransmission range of this particular node likewise for the other nodes also it is shownlike this and the other problem is to maintain the topology maintain the architecture inunderwater sensor networks for this there is this architecture the tic tac toe architecturewhich is a self organizing virtual architecture has been proposed by us in the iet wirelesssensor systems journal and here basically what we do i am not going into the detailsof it because it is not required i just wanted to give you a flavor of this particular problembecause this is indeed very important and fundamental in the underwater sensor networkcommunity so it is required to calculate the duration of connectivity between the differentthe water nodes and what we have done is we have to post this tic tac toe architecturewhich is a self organizing network architecture by utilizing the dynamic formation of virtualtopology so here there are three steps neighbor findingneighbor selection and duty cycle and duty cycle managementso duty cycle management means that based on the computation of how much the nodes areseparated from each other the other nodes and their corresponding duty cycles are setor reset accordingly so with this we come to an end of this particular lecture and whati have tried to do in this lecture is to give you a feel of the different applications ofsensor networks and the different research challenges in order to address those specificapplications and so we have also gone through some of the high level ideas about how toaddress what are the different solution approaches to address those problems thank you
