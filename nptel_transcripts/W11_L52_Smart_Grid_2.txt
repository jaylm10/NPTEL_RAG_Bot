we have discussed in the first part of lecture on smart grid we have already seen the differentadvantages of smart grid over the regular traditional electrical grid we have also seenthat this smart grid has different components different facets we have already discussedabout two two such facets of smart grid one is the smart home the other one is the consumerengagement when are going to continue and look at the other four facets of smart gridso we will start with ah the ah the operation center ahso we have different draw backs of the traditional operation center for example traditionallythese operation centers they try to make sure that the amount of generated energy is gettingused the grid is unstable if the grid voltage drops due to excess energy generation thereis limited control capabilities and there is no means to detect oscillation which leadsto blackout and there is limited information about the energy flow through the grid ina smart grid it is possible the smart grid basically overcomes some of these differentdifficulties with respect to the operation center by providing information and controlon the transmission system making the energy grid more reliable and minimizing the possibilityof wide spread blackoutsfor monitoring and controlling the transmission system in the smart grid something known asthe phasor management units or the pmus are used these pmus what they do is the samplethe voltage and the current with the fixed sample rate at the installed location andthen provide a snapshot of the active power system at that particular location and thisway it increases the by ah by increasing the sampling rate the pmu provides the dynamicscenario of the energy distribution system the pmu helps to identify the possibilityof blackout in advance and these multiple pmus can be connected together can be networkedtogether to form something called the phasor network and this connected information ofthe phasor network can then be fed to the scada system may be there could be a a serveror something some centralized system with some data acquisition and analytics and analysisability it can fed and further analytics can be performed for better use of that particularinformationso these operation systems operation centers they have the self healing capability so theseself healing by the self healing mechanisms it is possible to dampen unwanted power oscillationsthat means that you know power oscillations power voltage fluctuations etcetera etceterathey can be dampened and then avoiding unwanted flows of current through the grid reroutingpower flows in order to avoid over loading in a particular transmission line and thisis possible through the distribution distribution intelligence or distributed intelligence incorporationof it in to the system demand side energy distribution is also possible energy supplyis done based on the requirements of the consumers the consumers pay according to the consumedenergy and price decided by the energy service provider at that particular time and i asi told before that this energy now the price can vary at different times of the day andthe consumers they can connect their different appliances they can schedule their differentappliances to function ah at different times of the day depend on the on peak or off peakhours and everything you know each of these is possible ah through the help of advancedcomputational methods so in smart grid the energy distribution can form coalition andserve the energy requirement in a specific geographic locationso this distributed intelligence or the distribution intelligence implies that the energy distributionsystem is equipped with smart devices sensor based devices smart iot devices internet ofthings devices and this is where smart grid becomes very attractive ah to ah to the consumersso along with the smart meters distribution intelligence can help to identify the sourceof power outage there are different sensors that are used so from the sensors and theirdifferent data that are equipped through from each of the locations of the sensors it ispossible to find out automatically in a very intelligent way that where things are goingwrong what is the source of the power outage ensure power flow automatically by combingautomated switching optimizing the balance between the real and reactive power in thecase of reactive power the devices that store and release energy and devices can ah canstore and release energy and cause increased electrical currents without consuming realpower the intelligent distribution systems can maintain the proper level of reactivepower in the system and protect and control the feeder lines in the transmission systemnow let us look at the other component on the facet as i was calling it of the smartgrid which is called the plug in electrical vehicles pevs or if it is a hybrid electricalvehicle plug in hybrid electrical vehicles or phevs smart grids have the ah ah the infrastructurethat is needed to enable the efficient use of plug in electrical vehicles and what happensto these pevs is in the same way as we have these gas stations in the gas stations whathappened is these vehicles go and they ah you know they basically ah ah connect to theah ah to the the petrol pump and the petrol gets ah petrol or the diesel ah the fuel basicallyah is injected into the fuel tank of the car or the vehicle and then according to the billah that is generated the the basically the the consumer or the user he or she pays forthat that much of ah ah the petrol or the diesel the fuel that he has purchaseda similar sort of thing happens in the case of pevs as well so there are charging stationsas we have petrol pumps or the gas stations the here there are charging substations inthe city so these electric vehicles they are going to go and they are going to connectto these different points where it can charged the vehicle can be charged and depending onah you know how much ah charge has been ah ah has been received by the vehicle the thethe owner ah of the vehicle basically the owner or ah you know driver basically paysfor ah a that that much unit of charge that has been ah consumed ah that has been usedthat has been transferred to the vehicle a very similar sort of analogous situationhappens in the pevs so this is very interesting and plug in electric vehicles phevs basicallyyou know what happens its hybrid ah vehicle its a hybrid electric vehicle so you hereyou have not only electric source of energy that drives the system but also the traditionalyou know gasoline or ah ah you know ah ah traditional ah diesel gasoline and so on sowe have hybrid sources of energy driving the vehicles so sometimes it will be running ondiesel a bus can be running on diesel the hybrid bus hybrid electrical vehicle ah sometimesit can be running on the electricity so we have both the sources of transmissions ofpowerpevs basically help in reducing the dependency on oil and these are clean and clean sourcesah ah you know because electricity is a clean source so there is no pollution when runningon electricity pevs rely on power plants to charge their batteries and energy serviceprovider encourages the consumers to charge the batteries of pevs in off peak hours pevsalso can be used as a energy source in on peak hours so let us look at this particularfigure so what we have as we can see is here we have the power generation system and thisis the figure that we have seen earlier as well but here we are going to look at it froma different perspective so we are going to look at it from the communication perspectivehere as we have seen that we have two types of flows of information ah sorry ah of ahah of ah two types of flows one is the flow of energy the other is the flow of informationso we have the traditional flow of power ah the energy the electricity and we have theadditional information flowso this has to be ah ah you know so and why it is required it is required because sometimesit might be required to for the consumers for example to operate upon some of theirappliances or can feed some information to this ah ah to the to the power center to theservice provider service provider can be receiving some information their intermediate systemscan be receiving some of these information ah ah through a from the consumer throughtheir smart meters and so onso you see that what we have is not only the flow of energy but also the flow of informationso communication is very important smart grid one of the important components is the communicationcomponent and here we have the smart appliances smart meters and gateways these are communicationgateways the network gateways and we have the data aggregator units the daus the dataaggregator units basically aggregates data from these different appliances at differenthomes from each of these homes each of these homes ah and their corresponding smart metersare connected to the daus and then we have the meter data management system the mdmsthe so these are the different components of the communication aspect of smart gridso as you can see that each of these components they can form different nodes of the traditionalnetworks that we are familiar with as we discussed in a previous lecture so different networksare associated with the smart grid communication we have in the case of smart grid we havedifferent terminologies like neighborhood area network wide area network ip networkand sensor and actuator networks so we have different types of networkso for smart grid appliances the available protocol that are used are c bus dect theenocean and the universal power line bus and i am not going to go through but the correspondingdata rate and the the main feature are given in the slide in front of you similarly whatwe also have other thread the zigbee and simple cable solution scs with the correspondingdata rate and their corresponding features a given over here some of some of these likezigbee is something that we have already discussed in a previous lecture and this is not veryah you know zigbee zigbee is very attractive to ah have ah you know ah low data rate smallshort range communication ah established between different nodes in the network ah for exampledifferent sensors it is possible sensors in the smart grid is possible to have zigbeecommunication between ah between themwe also have different other components like the smart meters and the gateways where eachgateway connects very closely to the smart meters the gateways communicate mostly basedon wifi which is eight zero two point eleven the gateway helps in the two way communicationand the smart meters forward the energy consumption information from the home appliances to thegateways and forward the billing amount and the control information from the gatewaysto the home appliances these gateways act as link between the smart meters and the dataaggregation unitsthe data aggregation units aggregates the energy consumption or energy request of certaingeographical area this is very important and this is very much required so what we haveis we have a very complex problem and this complex distributed problem can be solvedwith the help of the traditional you know grouping or clustering based mechanisms souse of daus is very similar to clustering approach so what we are trying to do is forevery few entities in a particular area area we are going have this daus this daus aregoing to be the aggregators of the information and the energy consumption etcetera and thenthis daus after aggregation they are going to forward the energy consumption informationto the centralized coordinator through the mdms okso the mdms basically you know helps in connecting to the ah ah to the to the centralized backend and it maintains a buffer to queue ah the d daus basically they maintain a bufferto queue the energy consumption information of the consumers the mdms acts as a centralizedcoordinator for smart grid communication it handles it is handled by the service providersand it is part of the operation center the mdms decides the price per unit energy tobe paid by the consumers so it it plays the mdms plays a very important very crucial rolein the functioning of the smart grid so we need to understand this thing very well themd ah ah the daus basically send the data to the mdms which is located which is youknow which is located ah in the smart grid back end at the service provider end and itis a centralized coordinator for the entire smart grid and it it is part of that operationcenter and decides the price per unit energy this is very important it decides the mdmsdecides the price per unit energy to be paid by the consumers at different timesthe next part is very crucial in this smart grid communication which is the security aspectand it is very very crucial because we are dealing with not a traditional power systembut a cyber physical system and in as it happens in any cyber based system and any cyber physicalsystem security is very important there are different types of vulnerabilities in a smartgrid we have ah issues with integrity availability dynamic system attacks are possible differenttypes of attacks are possible different types of physical threats on the different componentsof the smart grid are possible different types of other complex and coordinated attacks canbe launched on a smart grid so so these are very important to be looked into when we aretrying to build a smart grid integrity is very important you know because you know itis all about use of data different types of data are fed in to the systemyou know different types of attacks can be performed consequently for example the datadata injection attack dia attack can be performed on ah ah ah on a smart grid and there by effectingthe overall integrity of the functioning of the smart grid system can be damaged veryeasily an attacker can manipulate the system measurements so that the congested transmissionof the falsely ah of the all the of the ah false data ah seems to not have reached tothe ah to the thermal ah transmission ah limit this induces large fluctuations in the systemdynamics that can lead to tripling additional lines disconnecting generators load sharingor even a system blackout so as we can see that overall system can be damaged if thisis not taken care of so this is a very important security conceptfinancial benefits can be there to hurting the integrity of the system for example youknow the attacker can manipulate the electricity prices by doing this one can by energy withlesser price from a service provider and make high profits and as you as you can understandthat it is very easy to do because the cyber system basically connects to the physicalsystem and through the cyber system attacks can be launched on the physical system andit is possible to basically indirectly steal the electricity at lower prices or even atlow process without paying it without paying any price electricity can be stolendifferent time synchronization attacks can be launched where an adversary can manipulatethe time reference of the time stamped measured phasors to create a false virtualize ah avisualization of the actual system conditions there by yielding inaccurate control and protectionactions availability is a very important issue in the case of security of smart grid differenttypes of denial of service attacks different types of replay attacks can be launched ina replay attack basically what happens if the attacker injects the input data into thesystem without causing changes ah ah to the measurable outputs different types of otherdistributed data injection attacks can be dynamic data injection attacks can be performedwhere in the attacker uses the knowledge of the grids dynamic model to inject data intoah ah data that causes of un observability of ah of unstable polesphysical threats can be launched attacker basically physically damages some of the componentsfor example the generator can be damaged the the substation or the transmission lines canbe damaged and different other types of coordinated attacks can also be launched now one veryimportant issue is that the smart grid can exploit the use of the cloud technology aswell because this smart grid as we have seen is a source of generation of lot of informationthat information can be stored at the cloud and therefore there are the very importantthings that can be done with the help of augmenting with the cloud technologyso cloud applications can take a lead in different several aspects for example with respect toenergy management information management and security management so i am going to brieflytalks about each of these highlighting their use but this is available in the paper inthe research paper that for the reference of which is given ah ah on the slide so thispaper has been published in the i triple e transactions on parallel and distributed systemsin the year two thousand fifteen and this particular paper basically serves as an importantreference about how smart grid and cloud technologies can integrated together to harness the benefitsof each of these and making the power system much more attractiveso as we can see in this particular figure what we have is we have the substation microgrid customers the traditional power lines and then we also have the communication linkand this communication link basically feeding this data to the cloud data storage and hereon the other hand on the other side as we can see over here we have another type ofcloud which is the energy storage so we have the cloud energy storage which which basicallystores the electricity over here and on the other hand this information can be storedin the cloud data storage so bringing the energy storage and the data storage togethertwo different types of in a cloud conceptually we are talking about is made possible withthe help of these cloud integrated smart grids so energy management and cloud applicationsare very interesting the energy management in smart grid can be more efficient by usingcloud applications with the integration of cloud requests from the customers are scheduledwhich are to be executed depending on the available resources priority and other applicationconstraintsso this is very interesting because you know so on the cloud side there are different modelsof cloud which can be utilized over here by the smart grid for energy management for examplewe have this ah platform as a service we have the software as a service we have the infrastructureas a service so not only that we will you know will be using the cloud for storing theinformation but different algorithms different ah ah you knowdifferent systems differentah you know software can be executed at the cloud end and that basically you know helpsthe smart grid to ah harness the benefits of the ah cloud technologyintegrating cloud computing applications for micro grid management in the form of attractiveah in the form of different module such as infrastructure power management and servicethe number of supported customers basically increase that way and with the cloud applicationsit is possible to integrate and analyze the information that streams from multiple smartmeters simultaneously in order to balance the real time demand and energy curves soas we can see over here lot of dynamic aspects you know can be managed efficiently dynamicbecause you know when we are talking about energy management in the smart grid thingsare very dynamic not only the pricing is dynamic everything is dynamic energy generation energydistribution energy use pricing each and every thing is dynamic and all of these requestssmart algorithms and software to help in ah you know in achieving all of ah these particularfeatures these specific features and the cloud can help in achieving this particular ah objectivethen another advantage is rea time energy usage and pricing information can be sharedbecause you know so in the cloud we have these ah the communication backend the network everythingis network together so this information about the energy usage pricing information theycan be shared with that potential customers and not only customers but also the otherstake holdersso that was the energy management then we have the information management so informationprocessing in smart grid fits well with the computing and storage mechanisms availablefor cloud applications information from different components and the supply and demand stateconditions can be shared with the help of cloud computing real time distribution datamanagement and parallel processing of information can be utilized using smart grid data cloudapplication so if you can look over here in this particular figure what we have are endusers substations micro grids utility providers communicating bi directionally with the clouddata ware houseso cloud data ware house basically has all the data so all these data can be stored inthe cloud data ware house also from this particular end it is bidirectional because the data canflow also from this end to these different components so we have this information flowin both the directions and this information flow has to be managed properly so then comesthe security aspects some of which i have already mentioned before so security in thesmart grid is very important and electrical power system an electric power informationsecurity ah ah ah information security and protection system can be developed using thecloud security mechanisms private cloud platforms are suitable for scaling out and processingmillions of data from the users and using the cloud computing platforms the electricalutilities can quickly and efficiently deal with malicious softwareso here you know ah this particular figure is very interesting to look at we have atthe very bottom the users the utility micro grid third party and through different authenticationah and authorization mechanisms these ah and ah in the interim we have this web servicesah you know so these basically can feed in the data ah from these different devices authorizedah data in a secured data can be fed in ah you know and can be stored at the loud endand the other direction also the same way because we have these different models ofthe cloud iaas paas and saas and these data can be basically you know ah shared bidirectionalbetween these devices and the cloud ah models and ah ah that way these components the intermediatecomponents and the layers can be made much more efficient and secure there by makingthe system ah much more secure than the ah the traditional smart grid so cloud basicallyhelps in this particular in the security process cloud basically helps ah in a big wayso security and protection system for cloud here we have the servers that act as the cloudand take decision according to the clients data their privacy issues in the smart gridah that also can be ah can be used ah can be can be ah solved can be addressed ah ahby the help of the cloud ah in a much more better fashion but again cloud security asah cloud security and privacy particularly is also a very a important concern and ahso we have the privacy concerns in the case of cloud which are inherent to the cloud pluswe have the privacy concerns in the case of ah the smart grid the traditional smart gridand how these two privacy concerns can be further ah addressed in an integrated wayis something that different people different researches are looking intoso with this we come to an end here are some of the references for you to go through ahso ah this particular paper ah you know it is authored by me it is published by i triplee communications magazine and ah there are few other papers i was already mentioningabout plug in electrical vehicles and plug in hybrid electrical vehicles this particularpaper you can have a look at to understand how ah in the smart grid and pev or phev contexthow dynamics pricing can be made possible this is one such solution which talks aboutit integration of cloud to smart grid this particular paper ah ah which is been publishedin the i triple e transactions on parallel and distributed systemsthis is a important ah this is a very interesting source ah ah i i can say ah and ah this isone of the kind and ah you know so by going through this particular paper one can understandthe different aspects of ah or the different challenges that are going to ah be phasedah ah by ah integration of ah ah ah of cloud with the smart grid and ah different ah aspectslike the how residential energy management can be done in the smart grid you know thereis one such paper given over here and ah in vehicular energy networks you know how energycan be managed this is given in this particular paper at the endso these are different ah papers ah ah that ah talk about different aspects the few otherpapers are also given over here very important papers ah are listed so one can you know ifyou if you are interested further interested to learn about smart grid you know these arethe important rich sources of ah of information ah about smart grid so what you must havenoticed is ah you know so what i tried to do in this particular lecture is to ah ahyou know ah keep our discussions at the level of ah motivating and trying to understandhow smart grid is important but we try to abstain ourselves from deeper discussionsabout how to build a smart grid so that is you know the the here basically you know ourfocus is not on how to build a smart grid but what are the different aspects of smartgrids smart grids if if somebody is interested you know particularly some body from powersystems background if they are interested to build a smart grid what are the differentissues that have to be taken care of and ah ahso these are the this is this is the focus of ah this particular lecture and ah how smartgrid plays an important role in the iot context because our course is on iot internet of thingswe do not want to really really understand deep into each of these technologies but wewant to get introduced about the different aspects smart grid is one such ah ah technologyor one such aspect we wanted to understand and ah so this is the reason you know we ahtry to ah keep ourselves at this higher level of understanding about smart grid and notdeeper in to how a smart grid can actually be builtso this basically requires you know building of a smart grid is a different semester coursethat can be ah ah you know that if somebody is interested with ah electrical engineeringbackground they can attend but this particular ah you know ah course because we are focusingon iot ah we ah ah ah you know it is important to understand the different ah important subtletiesthat are involved in the building of the smart grid and why smart grid is required and whatis the what is the motivation behind building smart grid in the iot context so with thiswe come to an end of discussions on smart grid in the case in the context of internetof thingsthank you
