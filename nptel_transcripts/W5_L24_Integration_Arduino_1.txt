this lecture and the next one are dedicated to discussing the integration of sensors andactuators with arduino platform so in a previous lecture we have taught you about ah how toyou know what is arduino and how to use it for building iot systems and in this lecturewe are going to show you further that how we can integrate sensors and actuators witharduino i told you that a multitude of several types of several types and several sensorscan be integrated in to arduino platform it supports for that and at the same time seenfor are actuators as well so here i am going to teach you about how to do itand ah i have with me ah mister anand rao mukharji the ta of the course and he willexplain to you how to do this hands on so as i said before that if you have the setup e if you have the requisite ah small electronic equipments with you then you can also do thesame to practice yourself so that way it will give you a hands on experience about how tocreate a small small scale ah small sized ah sensor actuated based arduino platformfor used in iot so this specific type of sensor that we are going to show you here we areusing only one sensor and we are using only one actuator the sensor that we are usingis the temperature humidity sensor and the actuator is the motor the survey motorso let us know have a look at ah how to ah build ah a small sensor actuated based arduinoplatform for use in iot hello i will be now talking about the integrationof sensors and actuators with arduino so this will be again in two parts in the first parti will cover integration of sensors with arduino and in the second part integration of actuatorswith arduino so first of all ah as we have already learned by now sensors are basic electronicelements they convert physical quantities or measurements into electrical signals andmore or less sensors can be classified into either analog or digital sensors so thereare few common type of sensors we actually use with iot they include temperature sensorshumidity sensors compass or direction sensors light sensors sound sensors accelerometersor mission sensors and there are lot many verities of sensorswe could not accommodate everything over here but i am sure if you find search online youwill come across ah huge number of sensors so now in this lecture will be covering ahinterfacing of a humidity and temperature sensor with your arduino board so in our previouslectures we use an arduino uno just for the sake of bringing in some variety now we areusing and arduino ah at mega so arduino mega so in the market you can just get it by thename of arduino mega or mega two five six zero so its bit bigger than your traditionalarduino uno this one has got four ah uarts arduino uno if you recall had only one uartand obviously there are much more digital input output pins there are much more ah analoginput pins there are sixteen analog input ah seven forseven or eight for your uno and the voltage inputs and power lines are more or less sameso we take this one now we again have are breadboard so these we have the leds and registersleft from the previous slides this one is known as a dht sensor so dht stands for digitalhumidity and temperature so as we can see it has four pins and starting from left toright if you keep this upfront this mesh region upfront starting from left to right you numberthem as one two three and four so basically you have four pins pin one we give a positivevoltage the last pin we keep as ground the third pin is the signal pin and the sorrythe second pin is the signal pin and the third pin is left open or no connectionso following this basic connection idea we put it on the breadboard ok now your pin onehas to be connected between ah ah to a supply ranging from three point three volt to fivevolt ah you should take precautions not to exceed this five volt range otherwise yoursensor will be damaged pin two is the data pin from which the actual sensor data is comingto the board pin three as i have told you before it is null on no connection and pinfour is ground so prior to interfacing the hardware with the arduino ide we actuallyneed the support of a few libraries available online so this sensor was acquired from youradafruit it is a company which supplies various arduino boards and related components andother processor boards so ah we are going to use the adafruit library for ah dht oneone of dht two two so this sensor we are using is actually dht two two ah your dht sensorlibrary it provides some basic facilities for reading the humidity reading the temperatureand so on so for now will just skip the connection okfirst will look for the sensor integration ah look for the updation of the library yourexisting arduino ide so we start off with we go to tool ah sorry you go to sketch onthe menu bar then there is a option for include library and then manage libraries generallyit is on the top so and the library manager you write sorry you just write dht so as youcan see i have already installed this library fileso you get a dht sensor library you just click on it and if your pc is connected to the internetyour arduino ide will do the rest you just download it will download the library integratedwith the system you restart your arduino ide in you are ready to go so as i have alreadyinstalled this library no need for anymore action so this is actually how you updatethe arduino ide with the required library so you have already selected the dht sensoryou click on it and it installs now coming to the actual sketch for the dhtprior to that will just install the hardware with the arduino board so if you recall thesefour pins starting from one two three and four you place it on the breadboard we takefour jumper cables so pin four was ground i connect pin four to groundpin one was vcc it should be between three point three and five volt just to place ifi will putted at three point three volts and pin two is the actual signal input which willcome to the arduino board so let us say we choose ah any digital port let say we choosepin number eight or port eight so we connect the signal wire from the dht to pin eightyou can choose from ah any of the digital input output pins so now our hardware is readyits quite easy so focusing back to the sketch part for the dht sensor this you have to forthis you have to include the library file you downloaded it contains a few header filesand other definitions so you must include that particular library file so first lineis hash include dht dot h right then from its own syntax from the syntax ofthe dht sensors library installed ah you just call dht then dht pin and sensor so you areinitializing that dht sensor so this is the syntax and we have to follow this syntax strictlybecause it is according to that library we just downloaded now we are defining to variablesboth of floating type so one is float humidity and another is float temperature right sothe humidity this ah variable humidity will store the humidity values acquired from thesensor and ah temperature will store the temperature values acquired from the sensornow within the setup since we are going to view whatever readings we have getting fromthe board or the sensor on the serial port we just initialize the serial connection soagain serial dot begin at broad rate of nineteen six hundred after that we initialize the dhtdht dot begin over here in the second line you have just assigned your dht to pin numbereight and we have given that sensor as dht twenty two suppose you go for the variantdht eleven then you just update this part as dht eleven or if you plan to change thepin number on the arduino board you have update that part over here so ah once the setup partis complete you go into the looping part so over here you can see the variable humidityit is being assigned the dht dot read humidity function so whatever function whatever sensoroffsets and operations need to be done is being taken care of the taken care of thedht dot h library so you just call this function read humidity then temperature as dht dotread temperature once you have call these to you just serially print these variationsso as i have given a delay of two seconds so after every two seconds your humidity andtemperature will keep on updating so let us go to the next slide so we havealready interfaced these sensors ah this is the code you just saw in the previous slidethis one ok then again we go through the basic stepswe connect to board to the pc we set the port and board type ah now remember ah the portand board type may change because board type will definitely change the port may or benot change for this we mega there will be an option for mega we chose it then priorto uploading we verify the code and then uploaded the code so this is the output we are expectinglike humidity is giving in percentage and temperature in degree celsius and these eachrow is separated by ah time duration of two seconds so after every two seconds your temperaturereadings and humidity readings are getting updatedso now back to the hardware part so i have already has the code open end infront of me right as you can see hash include dht doth then ah we have set the pin number at eight in the input pin ah sensor type is dht twentytwo humidity flowed temperature ah within void setup serial dot begin at broad ratenine six hundred dht dot begin so setup is ready and within loop we just call the humidityand the temperature reading functions and thats it and just serially print it over andover again with the delay of two seconds now sense everything is connected we just verifyour code so its compiling the sketch sketch is complied there is seems to be no errorprior to uploading will choose ok the board has already been chosen as arduino mega ormega two five six eight zero sorry two five six zero the port is already set ok now wecan safely upload our program if you ah pay attention to the arduino boardyou can see this board over herewe have uploaded the code to the board as you can see now i will again upload the codethese two lights the tx and rx whenever you are uploading it they will bring blink rapidlythat means your code is being uploaded so now your code has been uploaded ah just forthe sake of it you just press the refresh button now we open the serial monitoras you can see your humidity and temperature readings are changing so may be if you canlight a fire in front of it ah temperature readings go up and this hoping the temperaturechanges a bit you see yes the temperature is changing but very slowly twenty two pointseven twenty two point eight it will keep on increasing i am hoping to let as reachmy body temperature is now its touching twenty three the humidity is almost ninety eightpercent ninety eight point six percent and so on so i hope you get some ideas and youcan thinker around with these stuff so these are some of the basic sensors other sensorsyou can obviously integrate are ah like depending registers you can integrate ah light bit sensorsyou can integrate ah accelerometers gyroscope those are a bit complicated but yes they arefind to work with so that was the part covering sensor integration with arduino thank you
