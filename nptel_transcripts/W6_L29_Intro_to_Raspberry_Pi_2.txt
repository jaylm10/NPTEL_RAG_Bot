in this lecture ah we will cover the bit more detailed introduction to raspberry pi ah sothat you will get a concise idea about how you can go about integrating various sensorsand devices with a raspberry pi base system and maybe programmatically access and manipulatethem so first of all ah we are going to cover how to use that basic gpio pins and then youare going to cover ah how to integrate a pi camera with the raspberry pi for taking imagesah point to note is we will be covering both of these things on python so the programminglanguage will be python so since its quite easy and easy to integrate with raspberrypi also will be preparing python so first thing you are going to go about doingis a blinking led based project so basic requirements have your you are going to require a raspberrypi connected to the network you are going to require an led a basic hundred ohm registerbread board and a few jumper cables ok so before we go into this any further lets comeback to the raspberry pi as we remember from the last lecture ah as you can see i havenot it covered on this device yet but i have attached a pi camera so this module is knownas a pi camera and it goes over this side so you will see ah this is called a ribbonwire so it is already available with the pi cam and the blue sided should be pointed towardsthe ethernet port this is one point to remember you take this white jack out plug this ribbonand push the white jack in and thats your that will attach your pi camera to your raspberrypi so now we are going to power up this systemnow it is my device is booted up i will check whether we have network access or notok now we have got a functional ethernet configuration ready for operation ok we have got the sameip as the previous example now in the last example ah in the last lecture i showed youhow to connect your raspberry pi over ss edge from any pc so using ss edge you can mainlyexecute and run various programs suppose you want to transfer some file this wont be ahthis operation you wont be able to do using ss edge you can but its quite so the easierway out is using a ah ftp client so one i prefer is filezilla it is available freelyonline so once i open the filezilla the left handpanel generally shows my local pc ah contents and the right hand side will be my remotepc contents so i am connecting to the host the ip address was i put in the ip user namewas pi password was raspberry and under ports it give twenty two so this is fixed for ftpit give port twenty two and then quick connect so it will ask ah you will get a securityconfirmation message you click ok now you are connect to to the raspberry pi you canjust drag drop between the two file systems suppose you want to copy this folder ah icreated this folder name iot lets see whats inside it has three files two python filesand one image file sojust as an example i will transfer this to my desktopor better still i will transfer one file from a desktop to raspberry pisuppose i have got this one example dot py on my local machine and i want to transferthis to my raspberry pi i just drag drop between the two interfaces see file transfer was doneand now this example one dot py is on my raspberry pi base system so if you check again on theraspberry pi screen now there is a folder name iot you click on it and there you havethis example one dot py on your raspberry pi base system so its quite easy many a timesah programming bigger things on raspberry pi is quite cumbersome so i my preferenceis i basically program everything on my local pc and then transfer the eventual files intothe raspberry pi and just do some minor configurations and changesso now coming back to the raspberry pi so for the blinking led project since you aregoing to connected to the gpio terminal you will require two things first is the pythondev library and the other is the python rpi dot gpio library so you can easily accessthese two libraries over the net so once your pi is configured and ready to go on the terminalyou just take the commands sudo apt get install python dash dev once this operation is overyou take the commands sudo apt get install python dash rpi dot gpio so once these twofiles are ah installed on your raspberry pi base system you are ready to go so for initialconnectioni am taking an led i will check for the positive and negative terminals the larger one is thepositive terminal and the smaller one is the negative oneso the white wire is connected to the positive terminal the yellow wire is connected to thenegative terminal so this negative terminal i will put to ground and the positive terminalah what this i will have to check which port i have assigned so i have assigned port elevengpio pin eleven so its not quite straight forward as arduino boards for this you needto have that a reference table ah shown in the previous lecture so that will give youa good reference per which pin is which gpio pin so for gpio pin eleven so actually onetwo three four five the fifth pin on the inner side no sorry is the sixth pinso now connected this so my connections are ready ah on the terminali can obviously ah write my code on the terminal so best practice is there is a in built editoron the raspberry pi in nano so you write sudo nano and then filename dot py so if i wantto name my file as led blink i write led blink dot py so this will open a new terminal onyour system on which you can write your code python code since your file name is ah inthe extension of your file name is dot py you have to write your code in python andonce your code is ready you press control plus o this will write the code to the fileand you exit the nano editor by control pressing control plus xso this is the code so first line is import rpi dot gpio as gpio so this actually callsthe gpio library second one is import time since you will be using a delay function ahon python this delay function is ah denoted by sleep so we use a time dot sleep thirdline is gpio dot set mode so you put gpio dot board so there are two options you canuse it as a board mode and there is another option which we have not going to use nowso you are going to strict to this board option in gpio pin eleven is ah setup as the outputpin then the main looping part ah just a simple loop for i in range zero to five at that meansit will iterate between zero one two three and four five is because it is excluded wecovered at this in the ah python programming partnow gpio dot output pin eleven is true let me in settle send a high bit to the outputpin it will sleep for one second and again it will send a low bit to the output pin sothe physical output will be your once the high bit is reached your led will glow thenit will wait for one second then ah once the lower bit is reached it will turn off andagain it will sleep for two seconds and then turn off at the end you do this cleanup operationto release the gpio pin so you have already seen on the console this operationso these are the codes so one more thing since the in built python installation on raspberrypi oss are very rudimentary you wont be able to access advanced options without installingadvance libraries so the very basic python idle interface and editor you will be ableto access on raspberry pi so once you double click on this file this is my file of interestpi led blink dot py it opens up this code right so let us suppose you dont have a visualdisplay anymore lets try accessing this thing over the terminal so you login into my raspberrypi i go to the directory iot i am inside the directory i will check what are the filesand folders inside the directory by writing ls it will list all the files and foldersinside this iot directory so my code of interest is pi led blink dotpy so first lets see whats exactly inside this file i write sudo nanopi led blink dot py so it opens up the editor this is the same code we showed on the slidesit has already been saved we exit this now when i want to run this code i write pythonpi led blink dot py this was my led blinking program you press enter as you can see theled has started blinking so and it will keep on blinkingso again run this program i run this module you can see led blinks program is executingnow once you get this triple arrow ah symbol for the console that means your program executionhas finished so this was the basic integration and usageof gpio pins on the raspberry pi then next interesting topic you are going to cover isintegration of the camera or the raspberry pi camera here we are just going to show integrationof raspberry pi camera i am going to place my camera over here my pi is booting upok prior to this we will cover the basics of the camera so you will need a pi cam anda raspberry pi so your raspberry pi specific camera module for on the raspberry pi youhave a dedicated csi slot for the connection and the cable slot is placed between the ethernetport and the html port told you before the end of the ribbon cable you will find a bluetag and that has to be placed facing towards the ethernet portso once the camera is connected we reboot the system so this reboot operation has alreadybeen done now in the terminal we run the command sudo raspi config and press enter so thiswas covered in the ah first lecture on introduction to raspberry pi i showed you there were variousoptions one for enabling the camera another for enabling the exercise and so on so overthere you enable the ah camera option and reboot your raspberry piok now once this has been done you can directly capture your images using the pi cam by writingon this terminal on this particular line of code raspistill space minus o space any imagename dot jpeg so this will click an image and store it asthat image name dot jpg now this pi cam can also be ah integrated with python and themodule particular module is known as python pi camera so again you will need to installthis library because none of these libraries are by default available on your raspberrypi system so you write sudo apt get install python hyphen pi camera and this is the smallcode snippet for capturing your images from the pi camera using a python code its a veryshort ah script so first of all you import this library import pi camera then you initiatean instance of camera ah by this name camera equal to pi camera dot pi cameraso you must pay special attention to the way it has been written you see the first pi camerais all small then dot pi camera p and c are capital once this has been initialized withincamera you write camera dot capture then filename dot jpg so these tutorials are commonly availableonline you can go for advanced versions options also so these things are commonly availableon any online resource so this is one screenshot you write raspistill hyphen o space imagedot jpeg so your system will capture an image so coming back to the hardware part so wehave have our camera ready we have ah connected it to the your raspberry pi to the networkand it is connected to the monitor via sdmi portlets open the iot folder now we already have this code ready the three laying snippet yousaw earlier so this is the part of the code we are interested in we simply run this codeah pay attention to the pi camera module when it clicks an image then we have led indicatorgoing on so i run this module you see this small led indicator went offso it has finish taking the image see it has taken the image of the roof letstry another image ah we may delete this image also lets point the camera forwardand run this code again so the code has executedyou see it has captured an image of the studio so this is just one of the basic examplesof are you go about using ah gpio based pins for integrating various small sensors andactuators with your raspberry pi as well as io integrate larger systems with your raspberrypi more complicated devices like cameras you can integrate keyboards mouse and so on ihave already ah put up ah interfaced a keyboard and a mouse over here through which i am actuallycontrolling raspberry pi interface you can see the cursor move and using the mouse tomove it so this is ah as good as a computer ah additionally its ah um very low on powerrequirements as well as its quite cheap as compared to regular computers available onthe market so i hope you will be able to go for more complicated projects using this basicidea thank you
