so so far we have understood the different building blocks different technologies aboutiot how to build iot using different technologies we have already gone through in the differentlectures so we need to now understand that the iot systems as a whole comprising of devicessuch as different sensors actuators and different other communication devices like wifi threeg four g and so on we have mobile devices so you know all of these in the iot worldthey are huge producers of data so iot is heavily data intensive it is heavily dataintensive so lot of data gets produced in the iot deployments in the in the iot implementationso these data have to be number one properly handled and number two is they have to beanalyzed to make sense out of the data so that things can be made much more efficientwhere ever the iot solutions are deployed those problems can be solved can be addressedmuch more efficiently so this is the requirement of the data analytics so we have two thingsbeing discussed in this lecture number one how to handle the data data handling and numbertwo is the data that is generated and is received may be collected at a server either in a centralizedway or may it can be distributed the data can be collected in a distributed fashionso that data has to be analyzed to make sense out of it to make things betterso this is what we are going to look at so what are the subtleties what are the importantissues concerning ah this thing so this is what we have to understand and this is whatwe are focusing on in this particular lecture so this is divided into data handling andanalytics is divided into two parts ah so however in both of these lectures what weare going to do is we are simply trying to motivate ourselves and try to understand becausethis is a this is a introductory course on internet of things here we are not going tounderstand about the different methodologies for data handling we can or how to how toperform the how to perform the handling of the data or how to analyze the data that weare not going to understand in detail we are simply going to understand that what are thetools the methodology that out there that can be used for handling and analysis of thedataso so we start with data handling data handling basically ensures that the data is storedproperly archived properly and disposed off in a safe and secure manner during and afterthe conclusion of the project so i am talking about a project in general in order to understanddata handling so here we are considered ah we are considering the development of thepolicies and the procedures about how to handle the data electronically as well as well asthrough non electronic means so in the iots sphere most of the data have certain featureswhich are analogous to the features of big data in other words we are talking about iotsystems producing big data and what is big data that we will understand later but fornow we will just conceive of big data as data that is extraordinarily big in different waysand what are those different ways that we will see later onso due to heavy traffic generated by these iot devices there is huge amount of data thatis created by the different sensors and the different other iot devices huge amount ofdata is generated and that data it is big in size continuously big streams of data flowthrough the network so are are generated in the network for example if there is a cameraif there is a camera that is fitted so that camera basically streams in lot of data continuouslyso in a in a particular hour when the camera stream data is collected you know that willthat is a that is huge in size and we are talking about not just one or two hours butwe are talking about collecting lot of data over days and months and years and so on sothat data has to be at number one stored number two analyzed and then how you are going tohandle you know as long as it is not required after that it is no longer required how youare going to dispose off that particular data so all these things have to be taken intoconsideration when we are planning or we are designing an iot systemso i was mentioning to you about big data so big data there are different ah there aredifferent definitions of big data so one of these definitions talks ah says that big datatechnologies describe a new generation of technologies and architectures designed toeconomically extract value from very large volumes of a very wide variety of data byenabling high velocity capture discovery and or analysis so big data shall mean that thedata of which the volume acquisition speed or data representation limits the capacityof using traditional relational methods to conduct effective analysis or the data whichmay be effectively processed with important horizontal zoom technologiesso what it means you know all these fancy words have been used in these definitionsso what it means two things data that is huge in size that flows in large velocities thatis generated and disseminated in large velocities have to be handled in real time this is oneissue second issue is these data are typically unstructured they are typically unstructuredfor example you know text huge text facebook data twitter data you know all these socialnetwork data or the data that are generated from the telescopes the sky monitoring telescopesthe data that are generated from you tube and so on so these have characteristics whichare unstructured they cannot be stored using traditional relational database technologiesso how do you handle such data so this is a big concern in big data so that has to betaken care of so you know we cannot we cannot simply be concerned about simply deployinga network without being concerned about how to handle the data that this network is goingto produce that is why data handling and big data handling is important so we have as iwas telling you earlier broadly two categories of data structured data like what we havebeen using library information system student information system accounting informationsystem these are good examples of structured dataso these data are easily organized they can be stored in relational databases relationaltables you can perform different queries on these data that are stored in the tables andhowever these type of structured data accounts for only twenty percent of total availabledata in the world today and definitely it is a very small amount of data in the iotsystems so iot systems produce mostly unstructured data which cannot be stored in the form ofrelational tables so there is not abide by any pre defined relational model for the storingof the data traditional rdbms techniques are unusable and these data they are very hugein size they are very huge in size and ah you know most of the data more than eightypercent of the total data that is available in the world today are in the unstructuredform text fields video audio ah speech you tube data you know telescope data all theseare good examples of unstructured data even the data that are produced from most of theiot devices are unstructured most of the sensor data are unstructured cameras produce unstructureddata so how do you handle these dataso seven vs characteristics of big data earlier it started with a three v then came the fivev definition and now people are talking about seven vs of big data so what are these vsnumber one volume number two v is velocity number three is variety number four variabilitynumber five veracity number six visualization and number seven value so these are the sevendifferent characteristics in to the form of fees of big data so let us look at each ofthem one by one so volume so big data are characterized with large volumes of data andthe quantity of the data that is generated is huge in volume we are talking about morethan tera bytes of data several tera bytes of data of images video and so on and so forthyou tube you know youtube basically in every minute you tube in the youtube seven two hoursof video is uploaded so its a huge amount of data huge in terms of volume so this hasto be in every minute if it is so much then just imagine that how much it is going tobe every day and in a year how much it is going to bevelocity as the name suggests it concerns the speed of generation of the data so dataprocessing time is decreasing day by day in order to produce real time services olderbatch processing technology is unable to handle high velocity of data so we need new technologiesto handle these high velocity of data so these iot devices mobile phone sensors and so onin huge speeds you know high rate the data is being generated for example with respectto velocity hundred forty million tweets are generated per day on average the new yorkstock exchange captures one tera byte of trade information during each trading session sojust imagine that how much data at what speed is generated in the iots iot worldvariety refers to the category to which the data belongs and most of the data are eitherunstructured or they are semi structured and examples could be variety could be that puretext data images audio video web gps then sensor data sms documents pdfs flash etceteraetcetera so all these different varieties of data flowing through a single pipe in theiot world single pipe huge amounts of data huge volumes of data at high velocities datawhich is highly varied not not only consisting of text but text audio video images web sensorand so on so everything flowing togetherthen we have variability which refers to the data whose meaning is constantly changingthe meaning of the data constantly changes depending on the context so examples couldbe language processing so language you know it is context dependent so you know sometimeslanguage processing it is context driven so the the meaning basically varies with contexthash tags geo spatial data multimedia sensor events and so on veracity refers to the biasesnoise abnormality that exists in the data so ah the iot data that is typically generatedis highly veracious so it is important in programs that involve automated decision makingor feeding the data into an unsupervised machine learning algorithm veracity isnt just aboutdata quality its also about understanding the datavisualization concerns how to present the data pictorially or in a particular easilyunderstandable format it enables the decision makers to see the analytics that are presentedvisually and identify new patterns value basically means that extracting useful business informationfrom the scattered info so how much value the data has from the variety you know sofrom the data the from how much value it has it includes a large volume and variety ofdata it is easy to access and deliver quality analytics that enables informed decisionsthere are different data handling technologies that are available for use cloud is one suchpopular technology so here in cloud cloud basically has some of the essential characteristicsas per the definition of nist on demand self service broad network access resource poolingrapid elasticity measured service measured service means what depending on the amountsof computational resources that are used i will be built accordingly rapid elasticitymeans if i need more resources the resources are going to be made available through a poolingbased mechanisms so resources are going to be pooled from different physical devicesand i do not have to own these resources these infrastructure i do not have to own but ican still get access to these on an on demand manner depending on my requirement and i willbuild accordinglyso some of these basic service models that are there and some of which we have alreadycovered include infrastructure as a service platform as a service and software as a serviceso cloud is cloud with this three basic service models iaas paas and saas is a very importantdata handling technology that is available to us second is internet of things so in theiot world the sensors that are embedded to the different devices and machines they generatelot of data the sensors transmit this sense data to remote servers via the internet andthese data they can be either handled at the back end or these data can also be processedlocally at the age or in the interim somewhere in the intermediate layer so continuous dataacquisition from mobile equipment transportation facilities public facilities and home appliancesare an important characteristic of iot and the data that is handled ah ah data that isgenerated in the iot have to be handled accordinglydatacenters basically concern you know storing lot of data managing the data organizing thedata these data that are generated in the data centers that are that are that existin the data centers (Refer Time:18:00)they are they have to bereplicated they have to be backed up they provide sufficient network you know sufficientnetwork infrastructure has to be provided in order to handle this data and this datathey can be analyzed in order to discover problems in the business operationsso this is how the data flows from generation to analysis so first the data is generatedthen comes acquisition of the data storage of the data and finally analysis of the dataso in terms of generation of the data from enterprise systems data can be generated fromiot systems from biomedical ah devices and different other devices all of which are goodsources or generators of data in terms of acquisition after the data generation acquisitionof the data data are collected data can be transported data are preprocessed and thendata have to be stored we have different technologies for doing it we have hadoop technology forstorage of data mapreduce no sql databases and finally they have to be analyzed so forthis we have the bloom filter parallel computing technologies hashing mechanisms indexing mechanismsand so on the different sources of data include enterprisedata iot data biomedical data and other field data from computational biology from nuclearresearch from astronomy and so on now comes an data acquisition which concernsdata collection from log files from different other records activities interviewing if requiredcollecting data from the sensors from the sound sensors voice vibration automobile chemicalcurrent weather pressure temperature etcetera and so on so after the data are collectedthey have to be transmitted so after the after collecting the data the data have to be ahah have to be transferred to a storage system for further processing and analysisso data transmission can be categorized as in term data center network transmission andintra data center network transmission then the data have to be preprocessed this collecteddata suffer from noise redundancy inconsistency etcetera so these have to be removed theyhave to be preprocessed the data have to be preprocessed the preprocessing of the relationaldata mainly follows integration cleaning and redundancy mitigation integration is combiningthe data from various sources and providing users with a information with uniform viewof the data cleaning of the data is required in order to remove inaccuracies incompletenessand reasonable ah behavior of the data unreasonable characteristics of the data and then eithermodifying the data or to remove these problems or deleting these data all togethernow the data after acquisition the data has to be stored the data can be stored in thefile systems or in data bases so if we are talking about relational databases sql isgood enough however with the kind of data that is exhibited then unstructured data thatis exhibited these no sql is very useful no sql basically uses three different types ofdatabases one is the key value database the second is the column oriented database andthe third is the document oriented data base so this is about the data handling the differentaspects of data handling for this what technology do we have for handling this kind of datawhat technology do we have we have the hadoop technology so what is hadoop this is basicallya software framework for distributed processing of large datasets across large clusters ofcomputers its a open source implementation ah for googles ah gfs and mapreduce gfs isbasically the google file system and mapreduce apaches apache hadoops mapreduce and hadoopah distributed file system which in short is called ah is well known as hdfs has differentcomponents which are originally derived respectively from gfs googles mapreduce and gfs full filesystem so these are building blocks of hadoop hadoopcommon hdfs is ah hadoop distributed file system mapreduce and yarn which stands foryet another resource negotiator so without going through each of these in further detailwe will just look at only hdfs the hadoop distributed file system so in hdfs which iswhich is basically the important thing in hadoop so in hdfs there are two differenttypes of nodes we have the name node and we have the data node so the name node is a centralizednode which maintains the metadata information about the different files storing the dataand data node is a distributed node that stores the actual data in the form of files whichare again divided in to blocks and each of these blocks is replicated and this is whatis shown over here in this particular figure so what you see over here are these data nodeswith replication of the blocks and this is the name node so name node has the metadataand the data nodes have the actual data and these data nodes are fragmented into blocksand these blocks are replicated and consequently we have more reliability in the storage ofthe data in ah hadoop ah hdfs so we have the name node which stores thefilesystem meta data and the data node which stores the actual data now we also have thesejob and job trackers the job tracker basically runs with the name node it receives the usersjob and decides on how how many tasks will run and the job tracker basically runs oneach data node receives the task from the job tacker tracker and it is always in communicationwith the job tracker reporting it the progress that is made so as we can see over here wehave the job tracker and these different tasks which are monitored through the task trackerso we have the job tracker running on the name node and the task tracker which is runningon the data nodes so here what we see is the master slave architecturein hadoop so we have this kind of thing we have the name node like this which contactsthe metadata the name node and then we have these different data nodes this name nodehas the job tracker and ah ah ah the name node information and this name node ah ahbasically points to the data node of the ah data node in the ah in the data data nodethat is installed right and then we have the mapreduceso the map so what we have the task ah the task tracker is basically linked with thejob tracker job tracker and the task tracker so job tracker in the name node is relatedto the is linked with the task tracker in the data node so the job tracker decides inthe mapreduce layer the name node in the hdfs layer task tracker in the mapreduce layerdata node in the hdfs layer and so on so this is the architecture the master slave architecturein hadoop so with this we come to an end ah of ah thediscussions on ah the file handling and ah ah particularly focusing on file handlingof this lecture on file handling and data analysis and ah here some of these referencesare there and with this ah we come to an end and so what we have discussed is how datahandling is important what are the different sources of data how data have to be handledand how hadoop and its different components can come as an aid for handling data whichis which has the features of big data data that is generated from the iot systems howit can be ah how hadoop can be used in order to handle this kind of datathank you
