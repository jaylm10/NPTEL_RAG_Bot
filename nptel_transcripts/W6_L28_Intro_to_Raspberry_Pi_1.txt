in this lecture on the introduction to raspberry pi you will learn about what raspberry piis what are the different functions of raspberry pi and more importantly about why raspberrypi is so important in the development of iot so raspberry pi compared to arduino is morepowerful it is more powerful in terms of the computation or processing power additionallyit has better memory capacity and also it can integrate different types of sensors andactuators and this part is more attractive than compared to the similar kind of featureof arduino so we can do different types of sensors integration in ah raspberry pi anddue to the feature that it can process more compared to arduino it has better processingcapabilities and more features and so on this is particularly attractive for sensors whichhave which require more processing for example imaging sensors multimedia different typesof multimedia sensors which require more processing you know this sort of ah device becomes moreuseful so in the same way as we can have an arduinobased iot node here also we can have using raspberry pi we can have a raspberry pi enablediot node and this iot node would be ah more powerful compared to the arduino based nodeadditionally we have to keep in mind that although it has better capabilities but itcomes at more cost the cost of purchasing raspberry pi is more than the cost of arduinoin general so there is a trade off of course however it all depends on the requirementsif the requirement of the particular iot application that is being developed is to have some nodeswhich ah you know which which should act as a server then raspberry pi would be a betteroption than arduino second thing is that you know with raspberrypi you can configure ah raspberry pi as a web server you can even ah configure raspberrypi as an edge device ah and so on so there are different capabilities that are therebut at the same time you know more computation means more power consumption so if you havethe same kind of ah you know application with a more power consumption requirements etceteraetcetera ah and if that is not a problem then you know one can go for raspberry pi howeverthis particular issue is a a little bit you know tricky because there are certain scenarioswhere arduino can also come to be beneficial with respect to thisso we are going to go through ah the different aspects of raspberry pi and try to understandhow raspberry pi can be used so i said before you know if you have a raspberry pi modulealong with you you can practice as we explain to you the different steps the different featuresand so on in this lecture and the subsequent one the next one ah in both of these we aregoing to teach you about raspberry pi ah so i have along with me ah my ah ta ah for thiscourse mr.anandroop mukherjee ah like the previous ah few lectures you know he is goingto take you through the hands on aspects of raspberry pihello ah today this lecture will cover an introduction to raspberry pi so this willbe again a two part lecture and the part first part will cover the basic introduction towhat is raspberry pi the hardware system and how you go about installing basic operatingsystem on the raspberry pi and how to access that device so what exactly is raspberry piit is basically ah micro sized computer or commonly in common terms it is said as a computerin your palm ah more specifically it is a single board computer which is very low costdevice and which is very easy to access so this these are one of the main reasons theseare some of the main reasons why raspberry pi has become so popular with respect to iotas well as hobby electronics people so there are various variants of raspberrypi so some common variants are ah you have the newest raspberry pi three model b thenpi two model b pi zero so these are the once most commonly being used so there are othervariants also but these three can be considered as the main market holders so as you can seethe ram requirements for pi three pi two and pi zero for pi three it is one gb pi two itis one gb whereas for pi zero it is bit lesser at five one two mb the cpu is a quad corecortex a fifty three processor processing speed is approximately one point two gigahertzwhereas for pi two it is nine hundred megahertz ah gpu requirements you have on pi three fourhundred megahertz of video core ah two fifty megahertz video core for pi two and two fiftymegahertz again for pi zero you have provision for ethernet on pi three and pi two whereaswhereas there is no provision for either ethernet or wifi on pi zero ah yes there is a provisionfor wifi and bluetooth only on mod pi three ah generally video output is from hdmi portand there are ah forty gpio pins so these gpio pins are mainly known as general purposeinput output pins so this is the basic functional architectureof a raspberry pi so at the center you have a cpu or gpu ah you have various input outputports connected to it you have a ram you have a usb hub from which ah you can connect anethernet as well as you have various usb ports to which you can connect regular usb devicesso in short this thing is as similar to your normal pc right so this is the picture ofa raspberry pi so i have one raspberry pi with me right now so if you can see this isa raspberry pi three ah model b so over here you have one hdmi port this small port isfor the power adapter these are the gpio pins interlaced with some ah power pins like fivevolt three point three volt in ground and you have this ah processors this is the armbase processor you have four usb ports you have one ethernet port so and you have onesound card output also and turning it over to the other side you can see there is a smallmemory card attached so if you take it out so we are using a thirty two gb memory cardbut generally eight to sixteen gb memory cards are sufficient ah so the main function ofthis memory card is it actually holds the os of the raspberry piso first step towards initializing raspberry pi is you download the os available on freelyonline you load the os on the memory card and you just plug this thing into your memorycard slot on the raspberry pi so in goes like this and your system is ready then we needsome basic configurations to get this up and running and ah available on the networkso once your system is up and running you can see will you may access the raspberrypi based os which is primarily a gui based system so it is quite similar to your normallogo on base systems so you can see you have various programming languages which are alreadyavailable within this you dont need to externally install it you see your python two pythonthree scratch ah blue j which is a distro for java and various other options you havesome office options also so on so basically you get the idea ah there is one symbol forbluetooth the symbol for increasing decreasing the sound this one shows the ram usage timeand so on so its quite similar to your normal oven to based systemsso these raspberry pi gpios or the general purpose input outputs they can act as bothdigital output as well as digital input it is quite similar to your input output digitalinput output pins on the arduino boards we covered previously ok so if you pay attentionto this thing so these gpio pins these are a bit confusing so i have included one chartdescript describing the pin configurations over here these two red pins are the fivevolt power pins the black ones over here are the ground pins and the remaining are gpiopins so you have ah certain gpio pins which act as ah you know your qart txt an rxt ahthat means transmission and for reception ah there are normal gpio pins and this chartor this configuration is very easily available onlineso the basic setup for this raspberry pi will require a few components first and foremostah when you are setting up the raspberry pi for the very first time you will require aexternal monitor you will require an hdmi cable to connect the monitor and the raspberrypi you will require a keyboard and mouse a basic five volt adapter to power up the pilan cable and your memory card which will include the operating system on itso will come to the set up orbit later will i will give a demonstration of how to setup the whole system so regarding the operating system ah certain official bestows for raspberrypi or raspbian and noobs and some third party oss ah which can also be installed on theraspberry pi are this ubuntu made snappy ubuntu core you even have nowadays windows ten corefor raspberry pi is finite and so on so you can download your raspberry pi normal raspbianimage distribution from this link you otherwise you go on to this site you search for ah raspbiandistribution there are various versions of various releases you select the most appropriateone and thats it and once the download is finished you will end up with a zip file youunzip it you will get a image file and you just write that image onto the memory cardso for windows based systems since most of the people use a windows based system theinstallation for this image is quite easy you require a software called win thirty twodisk imager its freely available online you run this disc imager software plug in thesd card into your pc you will need an usb adapter for the a sb card ah sd card you selectthe device browse for the image file which contains that raspbian image and you justselect write so it will take around anything anything between fifteen to fifteen minutesto half an hour so once your writing is finished your memory card is ready to be integratedwith the raspberry pi so you can see you just select the distribution or the image the thelocation of the image on your pc on the right hand side you can see you select the deviceonto which you want to write and after both of these have been done you just click onthe right button thats it so now before coming to this step let me giveyou a demo of how to start off with the basic raspberry pi installation so over here firstof all i have a keyboard and mouse i will just connect them to the usb ports chooseany usb port i have a lan cable ready ah i am connecting it to the ethernet port ah thisis an a small monitor portable monitor so it is being powered by a external power supplyand it is connected it will be connected to the raspberry pi via this hdmi cable on thishdmi port so once all of these have been done you just plug in your power supply for theraspberry pi you already check check whether you already have the memory card in placeso it is there you just plug it in so now if you pay attention on the screenyou are booting starts so once the boot is finishedyou get a gui based interface so just like the screen shot ah in the previous light soyou have got one terminal you have got a start menu option you can access various programminglanguages you can access internet options have got options for mail you have got optionsfor other things you can also set up a vnc server or vnc viewer on raspberry pi so thatyou can remotely access the user interface on the networkso once the ethernet cable has been plugged see this ethernet has been plugged so it isshowing one ip so this ip will be required to remotely access your pc ah raspberry pifrom your pc so best practice is you go to terminal right ok one more thing the the defaultname for the raspberry pi distribution is pi p i and the password is raspberry ra spbe rry so whenever you are remotely logging into the system you give the i username aspi and the password as raspberry so first of all i will check for the ip of the systemso i give the command ip config so you see various interfaces have been located so iam more interested in the first part so this is going to be my required ip so now i willstore this ip and i can remotely login to the system using this ip so now my raspberrypi is ready to be accessed remotely so now i dont need to use the monitor anymore sothe main function of the monitor is to initially get the ip address for your system and forbasic configurations so coming back to the presentation so initialconfiguration we have done now enabling this ssh option ah ssh as you know is stands forsecure shell login so just check on your raspberry pi go to the go again to the terminal yougive the command sudo raspberry pi config and press enter so you will get somethinglike this right since i am already using this raspberry pi for quite some time this is nota fresh install so all the operations have already been performed but post first timeinstallation of your raspberry pi you need to expand your file system because these imagesare more or less compressed and if you expand the file system it will cover your entirememory card so your entire memory card suppose i am using a thirty two gb memory card butthe image was two gb approximately so it will now expand to cover the maximum of the memorycard so you will have lots of space for additionalfunctions installing new softwares putting on files etcetera ok so once you expand thefile system after this operation is done you reboot the system so i will go to advancedoptions ah sorry i will go to advanced options as you can see there are variation of optionsfor over scan resolution audio driver and so on and there should be one option for okand go to interfacing options ok for this distribution you have your enable ssh in theinterface options ah under raspberry config so you select ssh and press enter and onceyour ssh is enabled you reboot your system so this will allow you to access your raspberrypi over the network from any remote pc ah from windows based systems you can use softwaresuch as putty or any ssh plant from ubuntu based systems or mac based systems you canonly use the terminal to perform this ssh operation so my ssh is already enabled youcan also enable your additional options like if you have a raspberry pi camera there arethese are special cameras which can be integrated to as raspberry pi you can obviously integrateusb cameras to wireless usb ports and there are as you can see there are various otheroptions if you need to use the vnc server you enable this vnc option and so onso i hope you get the idea so i will escape this thing now coming back to the presentationonce the ssh has been enabled so we have covered this thing then file system expansion we haveexplained so as you remember from the live demo this option was there the first optionexpand file system so post this ah as i have already told you the basic default ah programminglanguages which are installed are python java c c plus plus scratch and ruby so more orless any language that will compile for arm version six can be used easily with raspberrypi so some basic and very popular applicationsyou will come across on the internet for raspberry pi based systems mostly they are media streamershome automation systems controlling abort virtual private networks a lightweight webserver for iot so like instead of having a dedicated big server for running iot basedapplications suppose you want to install a small iot network in your home maybe for homeautomation or home monitoring you can obviously go for a raspberry pi base system so thissystem will act as a server whereas your devices will start uploading data to the server youcan even run various analytics on the raspberry pi based server and then you obviously havea tablet computer based system so this raspberry pi is already a computer just interface amonitor and some external peripheral devices any other and you are ready to go okso ah coming back once again to the system so i dont require this anymore i just closeit now i will do one thing let me access this pi base system from my pc i already have theip ok so i will write for my since my pc is running a mac based system i will write thecommand ssh minus y then space pi at the rate the ip address for your raspberry pi so oncei press enter it will start ah it will ask for the address as i have told you the defaultah sorry it will ask for the password the default password is raspberry once you enterthe password you are ready to go first ah it will give some basic information aboutthe system and then you will see a prompt which will say pi at the rate raspberry piso that means you are ready to go ah so you can just see your file system what exactlyare there you can give a basic ls command or list file so these are some of the directoriesor files put in your raspberry pi you can even ah remotely start restart your pc orraspberry pi so for the end of this lecture i will just reboot my raspberry pi so i writesudo reboot press enter so as you can see over the monitor my raspberry pi has goneinto reboot again it is starting upso this was the end of our part one lecture thank you
