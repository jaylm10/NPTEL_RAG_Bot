this topic is on interoperability in internet of things internet of things uses differenttypes of devices these devices are made by different vendors following different specificationsthere is no one standard for iot so consequently what happens is for different things the differentiot devices are made by different vendors following different specifications again thesedifferent devices by different vendors they follow different protocols not necessarilythat they all follow the same protocol even the kind of users their user profiles thesecan also be different so there is so much of diversity that is inherent to these systemsiot systems and that is why it is very important to address this particular issuein internet of things one of the core problems or issues that has been studied quite extensivelyis heterogeneity of devices protocols user groups and many other heterogeneity aspectsin from different other angles so this has been studied quite extensively and one ofthe requirements to handle this heterogeneity issue is basically to have some kind of interoperabilitybetween these different heterogeneous aspects interoperability means what that let us saythat one particular device is following a particular protocol another device followsanother protocol so how do they talk to each other they speak the different language theyspeak language so they do not speak the same language so how do they talk to each otherthis is one aspect similarly at different physical levels differentspecifications different devices how do they talk to each other they all have been madein different ways because there is no one standard that has been followed in developingthese systems so when you want to build a singular iot system comprising of all thesedifferent heterogeneous objects devices protocols standards etcetera you need to have some kindof handshaking and that handshaking is where these protocols have been devised which canbe some kind of a middleman a middleware rather which can help these two different diversegroups to be able to talk to each other so let us try to understand the interoperabilityinteroperability issue in further detail so when we talk about iot we are talking aboutlarge scale networks large scale networks requiring the use of large number of differentdevices millions and billions of devices these devices are distributed all across in theinternet or all across in the world and what is required is to have some kind of cooperationbetween the different devices some kind of coordination mechanism to be enforced betweenthese different different devices to be able to talk to each other so this is one issuesecond issue is that the devices as i was telling you before they all have been designedwith different specifications heterogeneous in all respects in the physical device levelin the protocol level user level so in all different aspects so heterogeneous iot devicesand their subnets is a challenge that has to be worked on in the context of internetof things another very typical concern that is specificof iot is the device configuration typically these iot devices their configuration is unknownunknown all across the different configuration modes for iot devices come from unknown ownersand thats you know incidentally that brings in lot of complexity and that has to be handledanother very interesting complexity is how do you [hand/handle] handle differences insemantics how do you handle differences in semantics not only so there could be conflictingsemantics as well so different processing logics are applied to the same iot networkdevices or applications by different developers different user groups and so on so how doyou handle these differences this conflicts in the semanticsso what is interoperability interoperability is a characteristic of a product or systemwhose interfaces are completely understood to work with other products or systems presentor future in either implementation or access without any restrictions i think this is quiteunderstood in the backdrop of what we have discussed so far so what is required is tohave all these different units devices protocols etcetera etcetera that i was mentioning beforeto be able to communicate meaningfully so that there is exchange of data exchange ofservices and to the user it should the interoperability has to be handled in such a manner that tothe user the user should feel that he or she is getting access to the services of the iotsystem in a seamless manner the user should not have to get into how theseare implemented what is the translation that is going on so on and so forthso what why interoperability is important in the context of iot because it is requiredto fulfill different iot objectives seamless device is what i was mentioning physical objectswould have to interact with other physical objects for sharing information any devicecan communicate with any other device at any time and at anywhereso devices communicating anytime anywhere and any kind of device that means anythinganytime anywhere communication right so if we have to have anything anytime anywherecommunication then obviously we need to handle this problem so that is the reason why heterogeneityand interoperability are the core issues of iot that has to be addressed before largescale iots are made functional issues such as machine to machine communication deviceto device communication so machine to machine communication we have already gone throughand then we have the device to device communication in device to device communication it is basicallya standard in the lte advanced and ah so where basically one mobile phone talk talking directlyto another mobile phone ah you know that is addressed and then you have the device tomachine communication so we have m two m d two d and d two m communication and therehas to be seamless device integration all across in the iot networkheterogeneity different communication protocols zigbe following i triple e eight zero twopoint fifteen point four which we have discussed before bluetooth following eight zero twopoint fifteen point one gprs six lowpan wi-fi which follows eight zero two point elevenstandard so all these different types of standards all different types of communication protocolshandshaking with each other communicating with each other different wired communicationprotocols such as eight zero two point three and eight zero two point one talking to eachother that is required because otherwise we cannot have this seamless you know anytimeanywhere any device connectivity that is not going to be possible so so much of heterogeneityis going to be there all across then different programming languages are usedin different computing systems for example javascript in one java in another c c plusplus visual basic php python so many different programming languages platforms of differentkinds are used again there are different hardware platforms as well not just programming platformsin the hardware platforms such as crossbow ah based products talking to national instrumentproducts talking to cisco products and so on so all these hardware platforms can alsobe varying they you know ah different types of heterogeneous hardware platformsso interoperability is very much required in this kind of backdrop further when we talkabout operating systems for a sensor node some sensor nodes have implemented tiny ossome sos some mantis os some retos and some could be even implementing some vendor specificoperating system and from a user point of view some pcs for example might be implementingmight be using the windows os some mac os some unix some linux some ubuntuso all these different types of operating system from the device or sensor node pointof view as well as the user point of view then different databases db two mysql oraclepostgresql sqlite sql server sybase all these different [deva/different] different differentdatabases are implemented all across different data representations as well the way the datais represented very hard to handle this kind of heterogeneity then different control modelsdifferent syntaxes semantics and so on so these have to be handled so what is requiredis to have different types of interoperability and these interpretability issues of differenttypes have to be handled in different ways user interoperability is between a user anda device device interoperability is between two different devicesso the issues are different user and device device and device so how do you handle rightnow let us take an example to understand why user interoperability is so important letus say that there are two devices one is located a cctv for example in this figure which isinstalled in delhi and as you can see that it is also the location it is written in differentlanguage the other device which is another cctv is located in tokyo and you know it isits specification sets ah not specifications but you know the device level semantics arehandled in japanese language and then there is an iot user who is based in america usso this american user has to operate both of these devices remotely from america andthis is what iot does this is what iot does that remotely how you can monitor differentdevices you know the end you know which could be end not only that different devices butthese devices might be themselves located quite far apart so using iot both a and bprovide real time security service in this particular example a is placed at delhi [wellha/whereas]whereas b is placed into q so a b and u india japan america they all use different languageshindi japanese english respectively so user u in america wants real time serviceof cctv camera from the devices a and b so what are the problems that are going to happennumber one the the user does not know the devices a and b user doesnt know the devicesa and b number two problem devices a and b are different in terms of syntaxes and semanticsand this is this is what i was telling you just a minute back therefore it is difficultto find the cctv device user you cant understand the service provided by a and b because ofthe language difference and similarly a and we do not mutually understand [e/each] eachother for the same reason so you see that differences in syntaxes differences in semanticsdifferences differences in the user specifications all these are bringing in lot of complexityfor a simple basic problem that is code to iot the following problems need to be solvednumber one the device has to be identified and it has to be categorized so device identificationand categorization for discovery because for discovery you need to have need to identifythe device and you need to categorize the device as what type of device whether it isa cctv device or some other type of device and you have to also identify the device andthere is language issues ah between ah ah these different locationssyntactic interoperability for device integration and semantic interpretability for device interactionso these are the different differences in the device level syntactic level and semanticlevel that that have to be handled by the user and you see that when we are talkingabout user interoperability we have these different device ah you know different userssome user you know using a different syntax another user using another syntax or semanticsor language and the corresponding [lawn/knowledge] knowledge base is are also different the devicesare also different so how do these two users talk to one anotherthis is what user interoperability tries to address so for device identification categorizationfor discovery there are different solutions for generating unique addresses so these includesthe epc electronic product code universal product code upc universal resource identifieruri and ipv six the traditional ipv six based addressing as well so there are differentdevice classification solutions and there are two of them that are quite popular oneis the unspsc which is united nations standards standard products and services code whichis an open global multi sector standard for efficient accurate flexible classificationof products and services and the other one is the e class which is the standard for classificationand clear description of cross industry products next comes the syntactic interoperabilityfor device interaction the interoperability between devices and device user in terms ofmessage formats is what is the concern of this type of [interrupt/interoperability]interoperability the message format from a device to a user is [under/understandable]understandable for the users computer on the other hand the message format from the userto the device is executable by the device some popular approaches are service orientedcomputing soc based architecture then web services using [wes/web] web services restfulweb services which is quite popular for iot so rest architecture and the restful architectureand the corresponding restful web services open following some open standard protocolssuch as eight zero two point fifteen point four eight zero two point fifteen point onewireless hart ah and then following some closed protocols such as z wavebut we have to keep in mind that z wave is proprietary and this is a you know proprietaryclosed protocol not a standard protocol and that is why you know z wave devices will talkwith z wave devices whereas you know those which follow the wireless hart you know theycan talk to each other middleware technology so this middleware technologyis sort of like a software middleware bridge which dynamically maps the physical deviceswith the different domains and based on the map the devices can be discovered and controlledremotely then we have the cross context syntactic interoperability which concerns collaborativeconcept exchange and using xml syntax now semantic interoperability for device interactionand here we are talking about the semantics semantics and the exchange of the semanticsso the messages that are sent between these different devices whether they are understoodby the respective party if not there has to be some middleware in between which has tomake it happen so the device can understand the meaning of users instructions that issent from the user to the device similarly the user can understand the meaning of devicesresponse sent from the device so some of the popular approaches are ontology based approachnumber one which again can be classified as device ontology physical domain ontology andestimation based ontology device so ontology means what some kind of a knowledge base sodevice ontology basically is you know the knowledge base about devices so this is requiredyou know so if two devices have to talk to each other so the ontology the correspondingknowledge basis of the these different different devices have to be formed physical domainin ontology i do not need to elaborate this further so you know so knowledge base aboutthe physical domains of operation and estimation ontology is about you know based on the previousdata estimating what is going to happen so that sort of rule rule base has to be maintainedin some kind of a knowledge base so this is estimation ontology so ontology based solutionis limited to the defined domain or context so that is the reason why there is one theorywhich is known as the collaborative conceptualization theory that was proposed so the object isdefined based on this particular collaborative concept which is also known as the cosignconcept cosign is the short form of collaborative sign so cosign of an object is defined asa quadruple a b c d where a is the cosign internal identifier d is the natural languagec is the context of a and b is the definition of the objectso in our cctv example the cosign of the cctv is equal to one two three four which is somekind of an identifier for this cctv object english is the natural language that is usedc is the context of a that means here it is cctv the cctv is the context and d is thedefinition of the object so here we have camera type bullet camera type [equ/equal] equalto bullet communication equal to network or ip and horizontal resolution equal to zerofour eight tvl so this is basically the definition of the object with respect to this particularspecification so this solution approach is applicable for different domains and contextsnow about device interoperability let us try to understand before we go any further howthis is going to work let us say that even before we start with the device interoperabilitylet us say that we have you know two devices device a and device b and in our example letus assume that a and b as such do not follow the same specific ah same protocol did nothave the same specifications at the physical layer or you know the other layersso no common protocol is available across all these different layers so how do theycommunicate how do they communicate so this is the problem of device interoperabilityso how do they communicate so let us assume initially that we have some kind of a middlewaresome kind of a middleware which will understand the language of a and the language of b soit will understand the language of a as well as the language of b so this will help thisone to be able to translate what a is saying a wants to send he wants to communicate andsimilarly what b is say so this sort of approach not only can be used for device interoperabilitybut also other forms of interoperability as well so so this one basically becomes a translationdevice translation unit so if it if we are talking about two different protocols we cancall it as a protocol proto col translation unit ptuso this protocol translation unit will translate the protocols separate protocols or the languagesthat are followed by both ok so this is an approach that can be adopted and can be extendedfor similar other situations as well so we talked about in device interoperabilitywe talked about some kind of a universal middleware bridge which solves seamless interoperabilityproblems caused by heterogeneity of several kinds of home network middleware so this bridgeis basically its a middleware that creates a virtual map among the physical devices ofall middleware home networks such as havi jini lonworks upnp and so on and it createsa compatibility among these middleware home networks so it is basically some middlewarebased solution this middleware will act as an agent for this kind of translation or handshakingbetween two different heterogeneous devices so in device interoperability we have twoparts the umb core and the umb adaptor so this is let us say that physically these arethe devices so physically these are the devices we have a lamp we have an water tap we havea camera we have a computer and so on so these are the physical devices and they have tobe internetworked together and let us say that they have they they are completely heterogeneousthey do not you know talk to each other as such so this is what is going to happen thisis what is going to happen we are going to create a umb socket we are going to createa umb socket with different adaptors like this which will fit into these ones whichare the abstractions of these physical devices so you know so these adaptors would fit tothese abstractions fit to the abstractions of these devices and that is how this communicationis going to take place so this is the function of the adaptor thenwhat is this umb see the code does what it does is it basically helps in communicationdissemination of the data between these different adaptors using with the help of routing tablesso the adaptor basically converts the physical devices into some virtual abstractions andthis is done with the help of something known as the universal device template so this universaldevice template or the udt basically helps in coming up with the abstraction the virtualabstractions and that is stored in some kind of a database so this udt mapper will comeup with these virtual abstractions which are stored in the database and this udt basicallyconsists of the global device identifier global function identifier global action identifierglobal event identifier and global parameters and the umb adaptors translates the localmiddlewares message into the global metadata message now comes the core which is on topof the adaptor in that architecture so the core basically has the role of routingthis is the main the most important role of the core so it uses something known as a middlewarerouting table and from that from the middleware routing table with the help of the data thatis residing in it it creates the message router and from the message router we get the globaldispatcher that information is basically used at the core to send the data between thesedifferent devices so let us consider some few basic scenarios we have this particulardevice connected to this adaptor it detects and in a first it has to detect and it hasto configure then it creates some virtual deviceso then the device online status the device id etcetera are sent across from the adaptorto the core and then from the core this message is sent to another adaptor notifying the onlinestatus the device id and id and whether it is online or not and it is sent to another[apa/adaptor] third adaptor fourth adaptor and so on so this is how communication usingumb a and umb c takes place between two heterogeneous devices following different configurationsnow let us look at a scenario when the device is controlled and monitored so we have umba one then umb c and umb a two so this the first message let us say that these two wouldhave to be talking to each other so this one has to control this and this has to be monitoredright so the local control or monitoring messageis first sent from the device to the adaptor a one then the local to umb message conversiontakes place then it is sent to the umb c then from here a query or action request is sentto the second adaptor and then the umb is used to local message conversion for localmessage conversion and local control or monitoring message then this local message is sent tothis particular ah adaptor from the device then a response is sent back another responseis sent back and the local message is delivered to this particular deviceso we have thus come to the end of how the communication using adaptors happen in thecontext of interoperability in internet of things so we have seen that in this interoperabilityarchitecture we have two types of components one is the adaptor which basically is a virtualor [soft/software] software abstraction of the actual physical device and this you knowthis abstracted virtual or softwarized device talks to other similar kind of abstracteddevices with the help of this particular core the umb c and this is how the communicationtakes place across different heterogeneous devices in internet of things thank you
