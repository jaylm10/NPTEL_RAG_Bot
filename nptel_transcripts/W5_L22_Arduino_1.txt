so in this lecture we are going to get some hands on of ardunio programming and ah sothis lecture and the next one as well so two lectures are completely devoted to ardunioprogramming so in the first lecture you are going to get some of the ideas about the basicsof arduino and in the second one some of the examples about how the programming can bedone with ardinio so before we proceed further i would like to remind you a few things thatardunio is very much ah popular at present it is used in for different implementationsof iot throughout the world arduino devices are very much cheap they are low resourceconsuming and that is why they are very much popular for use in implementation of internetof things so in the first module we have seen differentthings we have understood the concepts of internet of things basic concepts the overallphilosophy of internet of things we have also seen that there are different types of sensorsdifferent types of sensing possible different types of actuators that principles behinddifferent types of sensing different types of actuation we have seen that there are differenttypes of networks that are possible for use for adoption for use in iot different typesof communication devices standards can also be used for communicating in internet of thingsso having understood those how can we use these concepts for building a real internetof things may be in a smart phone scenario at home to improve some of the you know dailytasks that we do at home or in a smart homes ah smart cities scenario like in in a smarthospital smart ah you know smart ah transportation ah connected vehicles and so on so of areall these we need to take help of different iot devices and one of the very popular onceis arduino so arduino if you have to use for the building of internet of things you haveto you have to by this which are very cheap and then you have to program these and thisis what i am going to teach you in this particular courseso with me actually ah i have ah mister anandroop mukharjee who is going take over and ah mistermukharjee is going to take you through the hands on of ah ah arduino programming throughthe from the starting from the basics to the little bit modularitly advance concepts ofarduino programming so i would like to show you first how a arduino device looks likeso this is the arduino uno so arduino uno arduino has different variants they all havedifferent ah you know differences in specifications and so on so this is the arduino uno and thisis this device that has to be program this is ah this has to be programmed as you cansee over here this is very small in size and it can be very much integrated with ah thisah internet of things ah you know when you are trying to implement internet of thingsit can be implemented on top so this device actually ah you know ah you know the the differencesensors that you have ah you know learnt in this particular courseso these different sensors can be fitted to this device the different actuators can befitted to this device and this sensors the different sensors and the different actuatorsin after fitting the data that is received ah ah from the sensors these can be sent ahthrough the communication unit in this which ah ah ah anandroop is going to talk aboutand how this data can be disseminated and can be sent for further analytics furtherstorage and so on hello i am anandhroop mukharjee i am the tffor this course ah i will be taking you through the basic features of arduino in this lectureso to start of with as you already have heard arduino has become very popular now a daysso first of all the main reasons is it is an open source programmable board ah witha built in microcontroller and the software ide and this software ide will help you changethe behavior of the microcontroller according to your needs so it accepts analog as wellas digital signals which can be given as inputs and it will give outputs which are mainlydigital so no extra hardware is required to load aprogram in to the controller board so for the people who have work with eight zero fiveone series microcontrollers eight zero eight five microprocessors they must have rememberedthat you needed an extra programmer to actually program the processor board and they are welllots of interfacing ics and all those things are not required with the arduino base systemsso to start of with there are few basic variations of the arduino boards ah they have there areatmega three twenty eight base microcontroller they have atmega thirty two u four seriesmicrocontrollers they have atmega twenty five sixty series microcontrollers and then thereare atmega ninety one sam three x eight e series microcontrollers so these are someof the core microcontrollers as you can see ah if you focus on this ic ah this arduinoboard so we are using a uno board to give a demonstration so this is the ic chipand basically all the other once are either the voltage converters or interfacing icswhich are required for the input output functions with this atmega series chip so basic featuresof arduino uno they operate at a voltage of five volt with the clock speed of sixteenmegahertz and they have fourteen normally arduino uno has fourteen digital input outputpins ah six analog input pins six pwm pins one uart that is universal asynchronous receiverand transmitter and the interface is mainly via usb of atmega sixteen u two so the boarddetails are as you can see from this figure you have a usb connector to which you connectoratmega board to your pc it ah the best thing about this is the interfacing is very easyyou can connect your system ah arduino base board to a either a window base pc or a macintoshor a oven to arduino base system so this is the usb connector then you havethe power connector to power on the device in standalone mode otherwise if you connectedto a pc address power from the pc itself and this is the analog reference pin you havefourteen digital pins which can be used as input and output as you can see starting fromzero to thirteen these are the fourteen input output pins and over here you have six analogpins a zero to a five which can receive analog inputs and these are some of the power connectorsyou have five volt three point three volt and ground connection and so onso these are just some of the basic components of the arduino now the the arduino ide isbasically an open source software the arduino system itself is an open source system thehardwares specifications are available you can in fact if you have fabrication facilitiesyou can actually fabricate your own arduino device so this arduino ide is an open sourcesoftware that is used to program the arduino board so it is based on the variations ofc and c plus plus programming languages and it can be freely downloaded from the arduinosofficial website so the basic set up is the power from the board is derive ah as you cansee the power from the board is derive from the pc using the usb so if you are initiallyfor testing purposes you will be connecting a it the pc to upload your program and whenyou are running at in standalone mode when your program has been uploaded on this boardyou can run it from this ah power supply input you plug in a dc adapter of five volts andits going to work fine then next will launch the ide then selectthe board type ah so let me show you so over here imi arduino ideas you can see so you have from basic functionalities thisis the code verification button this is code upload button then ah ah you have the filemenu you can create a new sketch a sketch is actually the program you write for an arduinothen you can open ah open an existing program open recent programs and so on you even haveexamples basic examples provided with the ide which can work with various arduino baseboard now moving on to this sketch the most importantpart is this tool whenever you connect ah arduino board so ah connected my arduino boardto my pc now from this tool these are the available boards you can seesince i am using an arduino uno it has been automatically selected but in case it is notautomatically selected you can choose the appropriate board arduino uno now for my macthe port is already this usb modem fourteen twenty one you can see arduino uno has alreadyin selected so now you are all set ok one more important thing is over here you cansee this button this is the serial monitor this is one of the good features are arduinothat while executing serial programs you dont need to have an external consoler that kindof software you can just use the inbuilt serial monitor to view the programso now the once the board and the ports have been appropriately selected as i have toldyou select the board then the corresponding port in your pc for windows base systems itwill be mored or less direct it will show you a com base port it may be cam four tenfifteen anything you choose it appropriately then i have already shown you this so yourarduinos sketch as you remember the program which is written in to the arduino for writtenfor the ardunio is called a sketch so it consists mainly of two parts one is the set up andone is called the loop set up is analogs to for normal mean ah c ah c plus plus base programah the main function you use it is analogs us to the setup function in arduino and asthe name suggest the loop function it is used for iteratively looping over instancesso more or less common from file you click on new it will ah open a new file and youcan tryout various examples and sketches so have also covered this one this is the verifybutton so the main feature is prior to uploading your code if you have ah syntax errors orah any such logical errors it will be caught during verification it will say your compilationas field once you pass this verification check you can upload your code so oknow this we talked about this is the serial monitor whatever data is transmitted throughthe serial port is printed on the serial monitor so ah sketch structure as i have told youit consists of two parts a setup part and the loop part the function setup is the pointwhere the arduino compiler actually starts the code so its just like analog as to themain function in c and c plus plus and various input output variables pin modes whether youneed to as you remember you have fourteen digital input output pins so you have to explicitlytell your system whether you want to use the pin in a read mode or the input mode or theoutput mode then the loop function is used for iterationso in this example code you can see you just use a serial port the inbuilt serial portso we just write serial dot begin ninety six hundred and ninety six hundred is the baudrate so you can have various baud rates will come to that will cover that in the consecutivelectures you can have various baud rates for different systems but ninety six hundred ismore or less the commonly use baud rate for most of the systems and within void loop youwant to iteratively loop this hello arduino so this serial dot println that is if youwrite serial dot print it just prints the hello arduino string otherwise if you writeprintln ln is actually new line so it will print hello arduino in the new lineso prior to this well look at the sample codeso as you can see in this hello arduino code within the wordsetup we have written serial dot begin ninety six hundred and within void loop we have justah written serial dot println hello arduino now prior to doing anything we verify thecode as you can see it is compiling the sketch if a code compilation is correct so ah itscorrect just shows how much memory it is using in those if if you are in error suppose idelete this semicolon now again i verify the sketch it will givean error so this is the good practice prior to uploading landely you just verify yourcode ok now the code verification is successfulthe ports have already been chosen i upload my code so it is now compiling the sketchand it is uploading at to the arduino board now the code has been uploaded to the arduinoboard since the function of this program is to print hello arduino on the serial portiteratively will open the serial monitor as you can see it is printing hello arduino rightso it is actually quite fast we can actually modify it will put up function call delaylets say ah delay of one second so this thousand days actually the delay in milliseconds willput of a delay of one second the code has been verified we upload data again now againwe open the serial monitor now you can see now the delay has been in case so it printsafter one second so i hope this was easy now lets move on to the next menu ok so likeother programs arduino also supports various data types you have void int boolean byteword float array string object long char unsigned char it is some what similar to your normalc programs so arduino has lots and lots of libraries since its an open source flat formah collaboratively people also people and companies and organizations they upload theirown arduino libraries so for most of the functions will obviously get easy access to variouslibraries so as you already know the pins can be configured to act as input or outputdepending on your requirement so to do this this function pin mode is usedso you can see this syntax is pin mode pin comma mode so this pin is the number the pinnumber actual pin number on the arduino board as you can ah if you focus on this board youwill see various pin numbers are written over here one two three since these are the digitalpins it is also written digital so in the pin mode ah against the pin you just writethe number of the pin so its that simple and the mode use a straight input or output ifyou want the pins to work in input mode like you are connecting various sensors to it whichyou will acquire sensor a inputs you put the pin in input mode and if you want to actuatesomething maybe a light or led or a motor you put the pin in output modeso various arduino function libraries you have digital write so which writes high orlow values to a digital pin whenever since you have to remember this thing mainly workson a binary logic you either have a high voltage or a low voltage corresponding to one or zeroso your digital write it either writes a high or low value to the pin then analog read functionit reads an analog function analog input from the analog pins you have six analog pins thencharacter function you have various character functions to check whether it is a characteror a digit so you can see the various functions isdigit isalpha isalphanumeric isxdigit islowerand various of the functions you can use to check whether the input is the character ora number or a alpha numeric combination and so onso this next one you have already covered this delay function so you will find it isone of the most versatile and commonly use functions in arduino so input is taken inmilliseconds as you recall we put thousand for the delay so thousand milliseconds convertsto one second so next one is will use a arduino and thenormal bread board to switch on and off a led now we have got a led we have got a arduinoboard as you remember this these these are just basics of electronics so for a led thelonger terminal is the positive one where as the shorter is the ground so we connectthe longer terminal to one put other to the ground across this led we connect ah two twentyohm resistance in series prior to taking input from the arduino board so this is led blinkso if you concentrate on the setup part within the setup you see the pin mode selected istwelve and it has been selected has output basically translates to pin twelve built actas output so will connect the led to pin twelve whereas in the void loop you can see thisdigital write if you recall digital write either writes high or low values to a particularpin so digital write twelve five means you are writing high value to the digital pinto pin twelve and you gave a delay of for one second then again you put the pin twelveto low then again a delay so this will calls the led to blink on and off with one seconddelay each now if you come back to the processer boardso we have connected the led and the resister on the bread board from one side of the breadboard we connect a jumper cable to pin twelve one the arduino and for the other since thisside was the negative side or the ground we connected to a ground so we simply connectthis to ground pin so again refreshing we have just created the simple circuit we verifyour board is arduino uno the port is already selected we verify our code now the code hasbeen verified we upload our code just as soon as the code is uploaded you will see the ledstarts blinking with a delay of one second rightnow for easier checks you can always use pin thirteen pin thirteen is by default for arduinouno at least is the is connected to the inbuilt led so i mainly check ah validity of a codebased on pin thirteen you wont require external interfaces thenso if you focus on the arduino board this small led over here this is the inbuilt ledor the indicator now uploaded my code the same function you saw on the external ledis being applied on this code i will just change the pin number from twelve to thirteenso we have covered these things we have connected pin twelve and the other side to the groundwe uploaded the load the code and uploaded it so ok this was it so in the next part wewill go in to more details of arduino programming for now thank you
