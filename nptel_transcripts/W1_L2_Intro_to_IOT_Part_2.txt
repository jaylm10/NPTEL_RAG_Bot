ok so now we are going to continue in this lecture with the other basic instructionsbasics of internet of things ah so we have already seen that in the future it is estimatedthat the number of things are going to be many the number of internet of things thatare going to be connected are going to be many so it is estimated as per one of thestudies that by two thousand eighteen almost we are going to be have twenty to fifty billiondevices that are connected that are going to be internetworkedso so many different applications so many different devices these devices are goingto be made smart in these applications so that is the reason why we are going to havean explosion or in the number of these inter internetwork things number of number of devicesconnected to the internet of things so as we can understand that if you want tointernetwork if you want to form a network a big network a joint network of internetof things that means these things being connected then one fundamental problem that is goingto be happen is there is going to be an address crunch the we are going to soon run out ofthe number of addresses that we can assign to each of these devices the different addressesfor example the ip address and so on so ipv four is defiantly not good enough peoplehave explore the use of ipv six but what is required is to come up with a completely newtype of addressing scheme which can take care of these issues the addressing issues becauseof this address crunch the next thing is the connectivity at presentthere are different various sources different various ways of offering connectivity cellularis one wi fi ethernet then bluetooth low energy dash seven insteon eight zero two point fifteenpoint four eight zero two point fifteen point one eight zero two point fifteen point sixeight zero two point sixteen so and so forth so many different connectivity mechanismsconnectivity standards are available so this is going to be another challenge withrespect to network so how you are going to have some kind of a handshaking between eachof this different isolated standards so this handshaking has to be handshaking mechanismhas to be devised so in terms of connectivity we are talkingabout concepts called unique building blocks such as the land iot lan iot wan iot nodeiot gateway iot proxy and so on and so forth so all most analogist to what we have theas the different components of the internet the capital i i internet that means the internetof computers analogously we are also going to have these different components the lanthe wan the node the gateway the proxy these different componentsso the concepts are very similar to as we have in the internet so iot lan is very similarto iot the internet lan so this is for local short range communication may be buildingwide or campus wide and so on iot wan is basically internetworking of two different lans youknow inter connecting of two different lans connecting different various network seg segmentsorganizationally or maybe geographic geographically wide and these can connected to the internetiot node which is the connectivity of the different nodes inside a lan or maybe a wanalso directly sometimes the lan ah you know the nodes in the wan can also be connectediot gateway is basically sort of like a you know a router or something very similar whichconnects to the iot lan so it is sort of like the outside world the gateway beyond a lanand typically connecting to the wan so we can have in a wan you know several lans connectedto each other through the individual gateways and proxy very similar to what we use proxiesfor security proxies for sub networking and so onso if you look at the first picture over here what we see is an is a iot lan so you knowiot lan we have this different iot devices each of this devices has its own unique addresslocal address and these addresses are local uniquely uniquely local so uniquely ah thatthat means what i i would what i i am trying to say over here is within a particular lanthese addresses are unique these local addresses are uniqueand similarly within another lan iot lan these addresses are unique so these are locallyunique addresses so it might so happen that a particular address might be unique to thislan but may be reused in another lan so the other thing is that these two different lansthey can connect via two different gateways these are the gateway nodes and also we haveseen that there is a concept of proxy so proxy basically connects helps to connectto the ex external internet so proxy helps to connect to the internet so it is beyondthe gateway and connecting to the internet that is offered by the proxy so some of theiot network configurations are restricted to local areas very analogous to what we haveas internet lans wans and proxy and this is what we have seen in the previous figureso the nodes that are within the gateways jurisdiction have addresses that are validwithin the gateways domain only and the same address maybe repeated in another domain asi i was telling you before in the previous slide in the previous diagram so the gatewayhas a unique network prefix which can be used to identify them globally so there is a uniquenetwork prefix as well and we are going to look at it shortly so this strategy basicallysaves a lot of unnecessarily ah unnecessary address wastage and although the nodes haveto communicate to the internet via the gateway so for address conservation as we have seenthese these addresses are unique locally but they can be reused in another domain but thesenetworks are connected to the internet this iot networks are connected to the networkthrough the gateway and these iot routers the network is connected to the internet andthese are connected through the routers and these have their own set of addresses andranges that means the address ranges so these routers have multiple gateways thereare connected to them which can forward packets from the nodes to the internet only via theserouters and these routers assign the prefixes to the gateways that are under them so wehave this prefix one and prefix two two different prefixes that i i used that are assigned bytheir corresponding routers to the gateway by so prefix one is assigned by this routerto this gateway prefix two is assigned by this router to this particular gatewaynow this is a very important concept that has been proposed because it helps to solvethe problem of mobility so basically what is going to happened is when a particularnode changes its position from a particular network to another network so let us say fromthis network is node moves and comes to this particular networkthe prefix is also going to change from one to two and this is going to make the iot lansafe from changes due to mobility so iot gateway basically the iot gate gateway wan takes careof the address changes without change in the lan address so within the lan the addressremains the same but with the help of assignment of this unique prefix the wan address changesand that is how the mobility addressing ah ah aspect of mobility is taken care ofso in this particular figure we see that there is this concept of the remote anchor pointand these particular entity in this network is the one which has the global view of thenetwork that is underneath that means this entire network comprising of these lans thiswan the gateway then a ah this thing ah routers and so on so this particular entity is consideredto be the one which has the unique global view of this network underneathso now let us try to understand few other concepts surrounding it so we have alreadyseen that there is a remote anchor point and if there is a change in the network prefixthat can be taken care of automatically and technologies or protocols such as mobile ipvsix can come helpful in this particular scenarios assuming that ipv six based addressing isbeing used so within a particular ah ah lan the addressof the nodes remain unchanged because they are within the gateway and so within the gatewaythere is a local unique address and the change in the gateways network prefix doesnt affectthem but it might be required for the nodes to communicate directly to the internet aswell and this can be done with the help of concept of tunnelling where the nodes cancommunicate to a remote anchor point instead of channelling their packets through the routerand this can be done with the help of tunnelling protocol such as ikv ikev two so this is howwith the help of ikev two this tunnelling can be done with the help with with the ahremote anchor point through the gateways so indirectly from the gateway to the anchorpoints the tunnels can be set up like this the gateway has ah you know associated ahthey can come with or without proxies and they can offer internet connectivity or intralan connectivity so within the lan they can offer connectivity between the different nodeswithin it so for up upstream addressing that means beyondthe gateway so gateway to the internet mechanisms such as dhcpv six assuming that ipv six technologyis being used dhcpv six for state based addressing or slaac for stateless addressing can be usedand the locally unique addresses are maintained independently of the globally routable addressesin cases were internal address stability is of prime concernso we have to keep another thing in mind that despite this mechanism of address stab stabilitythe lus cannot communicate directly with the internet or the upper layers which is solvedby implementing an application layer proxy so this proxies basically help in achievingconnectivity to the upper layers on the internet so most of the iot based solutions at presentstill are using ipv four there are very few ipv six implementations so what is going tohappen is if you want to deploy if you want to approach building iot by exp ah by expandingthe existing internet they approach one that i i talked about initially as part of lectureone for building iot so in that particular case what needs to behap what needs to happen is there are different addressing schemes that are followed ipv fouripv six and so on so something like address translation between ipv four and ipv six andvice versa has to happen this is one until we have a separate addressing scheme a newtype of a addressing scheme so handshaking or translation of addresses from ipv fourto ipv six or from ipv six to ipv four number one number two is tunnelling of ipv six overipv four so maybe some part of the network uses ipv six so these ipv six pd used canbe tunnelled over ipv four pd used application layer proxies can also be used and these canhelp in achieving tasks such as data data relayingfinally i i would like to mention that there is a concept of multi homing where a particularnode or an iot device or the sub network iot sub network can be connected multiple networksfor improving the reliability so basically multi homing is a concept that is used forimproving the overall liability of the network in what way so in the in the same state ifsome component of the network or maybe a node has gone down there is another network thatcan take over so for these multi homing there can be twodifferent approaches a proxy based approach can be used or a gateway based approach ii do not need to explain these two approaches in detail but these names basically tell howthe things are going to managed for multi homing using this different approachesso providing source address destination address and routing information to the multi homednodes is the real challenge in multi homing networks so presently ietf is trying to standardizethis particular issue so ipv four is being used some parts ipv sixbeing used we can use both but that is not going to be sufficient we have to come upwith a new addressing scheme which we do not know yet what is going to happen people arestill working on it researches are coming up with different mechanism they are stillthere are still lot of research effort on building addressing schemes for iotbut if i i ipv four is used and ipv six is used these are the comparison points of comparisonbetween the use of ipv four and ipv six the main point of difference is that because the[bit ligth/bit length] bit length the length ah ah over here ah in ipv four is thirty twoand in ipv six is one twenty eight the number of addresses in ipv four is s two the powerthirty two only on the other hand the address space over here is two to the power one twentyeight so we are going to get a large address space and i i think we already know that thereis a difference in the notation in ipv four which is a dotted decimal notation and itdiffers from the ipv six which has a hexadecimal notation for addressingso the here are few other points of comparison which i i am not going to go through and hereis the ipv four header format and here is the ipv six header format so these ipv fourand ipv six they have to what hand in hand until there is a new solution for addressinga new mechanism a mechanism which is completely different from these is proposed so they haveto work hand in hand so ah you know mechanism such as tunnelling or address translationmechanisms have to be used in order for this thing to happenso with this we come to an in ah come to an end of introduction on iot internet of thingswe have already understood the motivation for building iot systems the different applicationsof iot systems the different characteristics of iot systems the different challenges thatare involved from a network networking prospective what are the different components for buildingiot iot is a joint network but then you have to use a modular approach a step by step approacha phased approach to building iot so what are the different components froma networking prospective that can be used is what we have already gone through and wehave understood so with this we come to an end of the lecture on the introduction ofinternet of things thank you
