so this lecture on ah internet of things focuses on the smart grid so in the first part wewill be talking about the basics of ah smart grid some of the motivations behind why smartgrid is required and there after some of the more ah you know a advanced concepts willbe covered in the second part of the smart grid lecture so first part we are going todo is we are going to understand that what is smart grid and what is its role in theoverall building of internet of things and what are different components of smart gridso let us first look at what smart grid is all about we all are familiar with the traditionalelectrical grid in the traditional electrical grid what happens is you know what we haveis we are consuming electricity that is generated by some generating station and is basicallycarried through different ah electrical ah you know ah electrical ah ah transmissionah devices and ah transmission lines ah to either homes or to offices so most of it mostof it is all about the traditional electrical grid is all about from the generation thatmeans the source of the energy ah ah being generated renewable or nonrenewable dependingon ah you know how the electricity generatedso from the source how it is going to be transmitted and then at intermediate points there aregoing to be different you know substations which are going relate the electricity todifferent parts of the city ah for ah further use and also about the storage of electricityand so on and so forth so end to end from the generation through transmission to thefinal consumption at homes and offices the traditional electrical grid is all about sothis is what the traditional power systems ah ah you know people who focus on power systemsand ah electrical grid ah this is this is what they study the this is what ah they dothey want to study how it can be done efficientlynow as it happens with the internet of things as well you know internet of things when wetalk about there are you know so its its the advancement in terms of the use of differentadvanced information and communication technologies to make everything smart and when we talkabout that one of the important components is electricity distribution to homes and officesso that also has to be ah that has that also has to be made smart so that is where thesmart grid comes into picture the traditional electrical grid being made smart and how willit be made smart through the use of the ict tools different advanced information and communicationtools being used to make the traditional electrical grid smart is all about it is the concernof the field of smart gridnow when we talk about smart grid it concerns energy generation and energy generation istypically done in a centralized manner at the different power plants and this generationcan be as i said before this generation can be of two types either you know through nonrenewablesources like ah you know coal and so on and so forth nonrenewable sources electricitycan be generated or from the renewable sources like wind solar power and so onnow this energy that is generated at the different power plants through the centralized mechanismstypically in the traditional field that is then ah you know distributed in a typicallytraditionally in one direction from the power plant to the homes or industries or officesand traditionally this particular flow of electricity is monitored and the restorationlike if something goes wrong the restoration of the grid is also done manually so whathappens is what we have is unidirectional communication so not that the energy flowsunidirectionally but also the communication is also unidirectional from the source tothe end consumersnow in a smart grid basically there is a divergence from this traditional concept of that meansthat additional electrical grid concept in the smart grid as i was telling before thatyou use the information and communication technologies the different variance of itthe different types of it to achieve higher reliability in power systems number one andoverall making the system smart and what kind of system we have here it is a cyber physicalsystem it is a cyber physical system that is equipped with sustainable models of energyproduction distribution and final use by the consumers and what is a cyber physical systemby the way in a nut shell its cyber physical system is an integral component of internetof things in a nut shell what happens is in any cyber physical system smart grid beinga good example of it in any cyber physical system the cyber part that means the internetor the network ah ah ah part is intertwined very tightly with the physical system so physicalsystem the cyber system cyber based system that means the internet based or the networkbased system being intertwined very tightly in order to make it smart so that it can dothings much more efficiently than the traditionally you know exclusive physical system so thisis a cyber physical system which is being used wide widely ah in in the building ofinternet of thingsnow let us move ahead so we have a smart grid which is conceptualized as a plant nationwidenetwork that uses information technology to deliver electricity efficiently reliably andsecurely this is very important you know so we have so many different problems with thetraditional smart grid the sorry traditionally electric grid so what is you see we you inour country for example i mean many countries you know with the distribution generationto distribution and use there are lot of problems we have theft of electricity you know electricitybeing stored stolen while in transient before it is actually being used by the legitimateconsumerso smart grid basically also tries to address this particular problem that how securelythis electricity can be transmitted to the legitimate and the the actual consumers theinternet consumers so delivering the electricity efficiently reliably reliable means if somethinggoes wrong how things can be taken care of and if somethings it may be some subsystemgoes down may be a substation for example in the overall distribution system goes downthen even if it goes down the smart grid is going to still function without any interruptionand everything will be remain fine so that is not possible with the traditional electricalgrid and which is possible with the smart gridso you know smart grid as we are using computer based methodologies information technologycommunication technology etcetera so it becomes it becomes very interesting so some peopleprefer to call smart grid as electricity with brain some people prefer to call it as theenergy internet some even prefer to call it as the electro net so nist which is an organizationbased in us they defined smart grid as a modernized grid that enables bi directional flow of energyand uses the two way communication and control capabilities that will lead to an array ofnew functionalities and applications the overall thing is service electricity is a serviceright so offering the electricity the n consumers are getting this service in their homes andtheir offices and in the industries and you know workshops and so on and so forthso but what makes electricity ah smart grid ah ah ah smarter or interesting is that wehave two way communication two way communication not only from the source towards one directionis from the source towards the end users and the other direction is from the end usersto towards the source or in in the interim the different substations micro grids andso on so these are some of this ah terminologies that will become more familiar as we proceedthrough but you know so like this there are other functionalities as well and it is amod ah modernized power grid that that is the core concept the heart of smart gridthere are different benefits of smart grid ah one is that it is possible to more efficientlytransmit electricity than the traditional one traditional electric grid it is it hasquicker restoration of electricity after power disturbances reduced operations and managementcosts for utilities and ultimately lower power costs for consumers reduced peak demand whichwill also help lower electricity rates so what it means is basically you know thereare certain peak times of electricity uses and during that basically you know what happensis during the peak time most of the users are connected and they consume ah lots ofvolumes of electricity and with the smart grid it is possible to have reduced peak periodsand overall distribution of electricity use is moderated over the entire length of thedayso this is possible with the smart grid better integration of customer owner power generationsystems including renewable renewable ah energy systems now a days as we have already experiencedso not only we are using power from the main power distribution centers but also many ofus we have you know other you know we exploit the different other sources of energy therenewable sources of energy we have many of us we use ah these ah ah the solar power panelsright so the solar panels are used to ah you know harness the solar energy similarly smallwind turbines are also used wind ah ah sources of energy can be ah ah you know exploitedcan be used and they can not only be used locally by the by these different users butif there is any surplus energy that is generated through these renewable ah means they canbe even stored and can even be distributed and that surplus energy can be even fed backto the main grid so these are all possible with the smart grid which was not possiblebefore with the electric ah traditional gridthen improved security is very interesting because you know power theft is one thingand the second thing is there are different other you know different attacks that is possibleah on the on these like it is a cyber physical system like any other cyber physical systemor any other computer based system you know smart grids are also vulnerable to differentattacks and if it is a traditional electrical grid that attacks are even more you can youknow it is possible to bring down a particular ah ah electrical grid ah due to differentattacks so you know improved security is one such feature which ah tries to overcome theseproblems of the traditional gridso using smart rid both the consumers and the energy service providers or stake holderscan get benefited everybody gets benefited all kind of stake holders get benefited okso let us look at the different benefits benefits for the customers let us first look at iteverybody gets benefited what are specific benefits to the customers for customers orthe consumers the benefit of using smart grid are that they can get updated informationof their energy usage in real time at any time basically whenever they want you knowcustomers basically you know they can get an update about how much energy they are usingin fact not only that cast you know customers they can they can also not only that theycan monitor their inner energy usage but they can also program that in ok so this ah duringthis time of the day you know i will be using this much energy i planned to use this muchof energy during the other times i will be using you know ah ah this much of energy someother amount of energy and so onso all these different planning everything can be programmed by the customers of thesmart grid customers in the smart grid another thing is electric cars there ah you know sonow a days we are taking about plug in electrical vehicles ah hybrid electric vehicles and soon pvs phevs and so ons these are possible in ah to be used ah by the customers in thesmart grid smart appliances so appliances which can ah like you know we have smart ahair conditioners ah smart ah ah refrigerators and so on and different other smart devicesah ah ah everything is possible in the in in in the whole world of smart grid it ispossible to program the smart devices to run during the off peak hours to lower energybills so you know so there is some at certain times of the day there is peak ah the it isa it becomes a peak hour peak hour means that during that time basically ah you know everybodyis trying to ah ah ah you know have different appliances connected and use consume ah electricityah ah much more ah than few other times of the day ahso those are the off peak hours so its so during the off peak hours you know if onecustomer wants they can run certain appliances during the off peak hours and the other thebare basic necessities ah those appliances can be ah ah run during the peak hours andso on so it can be distributed so and all of these things can be done by the customerhimself or herself and that is all possible ah in the ah in the world of smart grid andthe different pricing options are also possible so in the traditional electrical grid as ithappens ah you know so there is a single rate ah you know so at one particular rate thatapplies to all customers (Refer Time:17:00) at all times of the day the week the monthand so onso in the smart grid it is possible to have the customers can enjoy different pricinglevels different costs at different times of the day week month and so on so all thesethings are possible and the customer gets benefited by using smart grid in differentways other stake holders can also benefit from this smart grid as follows for exampleah you know overall by the introduction of the smart grid the grid becomes more reliableas i already said before the possibilities of blackouts and brown outs so black out meansthat that you know ah power you know power ah ah consumption is no longer possible sothere is ah a complete ah ah you know power is completely cut off for longer durationsof timeso that is a power blackout what is burn out brown out sorry what is brown out brown outis basically that for few hours there is going to be reduced levels of voltage for exampleyou know that we often experience that at certain times of the day at at certain timesnot always that some are particularly you know if we are using the bulbs the incandescentbulbs we see that the bulbs are glowing at ah lower strength and ah like this you knowso so that is because the the overall ah electricity load ah in the in the line in the grid islowerso brown outs can happen when we have you know intentionally ah typically intentionallyit can be unintentional also that for few hours the electricity load in the grid islower its not a complete black out but with reduced load so that is the brown out so sothe stake holders the other stake holders they can basically make it possible to haveblack outs or burn brown outs sorry ah to reduce the possibilities of black outs andbrown outs providing infrastructure for monitoring analysis and decision making is possible increasinggrid resiliency by providing detailed informationreducing the inefficacies in energy delivery you know if there a certain points where thereis some energy leakage or something something so those things those inefficiencies can beah you know more efficiently addressed ah ah by ah ah ah the smart grid and that isvery ah important ah particularly for the stake holder the service providers ah andso on and there are other ah important ah features also it is possible to ah you knowsupplement ah ah ah these ah traditional power grid with the ah with the renewable sourcesas i said before for the customers as well and same thing is possible for the stake holdersand the stake holders get benefited as well because you know they can supplement the mainsource of energy with wind sonar and other renewable sources so through the use of microgrids and overall the you know over all the management of these distributed sources ofenergy their storage from the generation to the storage and use everything can be doneeverything can be managed in a much more improved fashionthere are different properties of ah the smart grid ah consumer ah participation ah withrespect to that ah we have real time monitoring of consumption control of smart appliancesbuilding automation so all these things are possible with the help of smart grid and ihave already mentioned about real time pricing you know at different times of the day differentwhenever there is a requirement whenever there is necessity ah you know prices can be changedby the stake holders and can be enjoyed by the consumers of course there has to be certainpolicies and those policies have to agreed upon by a between these end consumers andthe service providersso that is a completely different issue but this is made possible by this technology realtime pricing is possible with the help of smart grid distributed generation integrationof renewable energy sources and integration of micro grid other properties include a powersystem efficiency ah so including power monitoring it is possible to monitor the power in realtime at all times asset management and ah optimal utilization ah is possible in a smartgrid context distributed automation and protection so everything is possible ah in the case ofsmart grid and making the overall power system efficient in terms of power quality self healingbehavior is exhibited by smart grid self healing means if something goes wrong the system willbe able to heal up on its own a some component may be has broken down some subsystem a transformerhas grown out still the system can continue you know it will heal up on its own and itwill continue to function as usual without much interaps interruptionfrequency monitoring control load forecasting that is possible and i dont think i need toelaborate that the overall electrical load can be forecasted ah ah in the ah in the smartgrid and accordingly the power distribution can be made possible and reducing the overallblack out and burn times sorry brown out times ah is possible with the help of road forecastingand anticipation of any any type of disturbance any type of interruption is possible ah withthe help of smart gridso here is the smart grid architecture if we look at ah you know so ah what we haveis we have the source of power generation and from the source of power generation whichcan be from the renewable as well as the nonrenewable sources this energy is as you can see throughthe different transmission lines and distribution systems these energy is fed to different officesand homes and these form something known as the neighborhood area network and ah theneach of these homes have different appliances smart appliances including a smart meter theyou know it is a smart meter not a traditional ah ah regular kind of meter but its a smartmeter which can be programmed as well so and different smart appliances and the homes smartmeters you know so these can ah be made possiblenow what what is interesting is that so this is this is the traditional basically thisis more of like a traditional ah flow of energy but alongside what we also have is that connectivityto different networks we have the sensors and different actuators being used a in thissource ah you know in the power generation sources then ip networks can be connectedah to the something known as the mdms the meter data management system and ah thesecan impact ah the mdms can be connected by when ah or even the other ah internet connectivityah to the power distribution systems ah then we have the data aggregator unit which isbasically sort of like ah from each of these homes this information ah they can be aggregatedat the data aggregated unit and this data aggregated unit has a metering data bufferah ah which basically stores and buffers the data ah and so on so as we can see that wehave (Refer Time:25:00) basically a and handshaking ah with ah ah or handshaking between ah thetraditional power ah distribution and the information ah flow so we have ah you knowin a smart grid we have both the flows energy flows and ah a energy flow and ah also theinformation flow together so here is the conceptual model of the smartgrid we have different components as we can see over here we have ah ah we have the customerswe have ah the service providers we have the operation centers we have markets transmissionah ah systems distribution systems and of course the generation system so this is specificallyshowing these different ah you know flow of ah energy as well as ah the commination flowsthese dotted lines over here are showing the communication flow sorry the this is thisis the sorry this is the electric ah electrical flow these dotted lines ah are the electricalflows ah between the customer ah ah the distribution system ah transmission system generation systemand so on and these blue colored ones are basically the ah it they are showing the itis a depicting basically the flow of communication and its a secure flow of communication inthe case of smart grid so there are different components of the smartgrid we have the smart home then we have the renewable energy consumer engagement ah operationcenter ah distribution ah distribution intelligence and plug in electric vehicles so we are goingto take up each one of these one by one and we are going to discuss them in more depthso we will start with the smart home so in a smart home what we have our smart appliancesand they use these different emerging smart grid technologies to save energy and ah atlower i mean different rates you know ah prices different ah rates and the different pricescan be used and these continue ah these contribute to the smooth and efficient functioning ofthe ah electric grid the interactive relationship between the gridoperators utilities and consumers help in proper functioning of the smart grid technologiesand there are different in a smart home there are different computerized controls that helpeto minimize the energy use at different times of the day from the power grid and if thepower grid is is under ah stress that means there is high demand etcetera then this powerload can also be shifted ah in the ah in a smart home and ah so that basically you knowwhat can happen is power can be distributed between the on peak hours and the off peakhours and that way the power distribution in a smart home can be ah rationalized sothat the users are benefited ah by you know so they can be having different appliancesthat can be connected at different times of the day depending on whether it is a peakhour or it is an off peak hour so in a smart home what we have is somethinglike this so we have smart meters smart appliances and there is a home power generation systemas well so you know on the roof tops there can be these power panels ah the solar panelsand the solar panels can additionally generate some electricity to supplement the electricitythat is ah that is supplied to the home in a smart home the one of the important componentsis the smart meter and this is a programmable meter and this meter can be programmed insuch a way that at different times of the day the different appliances can be ah ahcan be enjoying the ah different ah ah you know loads of electricity at different ratesso the smart meters basically they provide the smart grid interface between the consumerand the energy service provider and they operate digitally that means computerized ah ah youknow so they have small computers embedded in them and they allow for automated and complextransfer of information between the consumer and the energy service provider and that waythe consumers can enjoy reduced energy cost so in a smart home the ah ah you know smarthome basically allows the consumers to trace sorry to track the energy use in detail tosave energy in a better way ah so basically you know what happens is you have somethingcalled the home energy management systems so these home energy management systems basicallyallows these particular thing to be done these home energy management system also allowsconsumers to monitor a real time information and price signals from the energy serviceprovider it also allows to create settings to automatically use power when prices arelowest it helps in avoiding big demand rates prevents black outs and brown outs in returnthe service provider may also choose to provide financial incentivessmart l appliances in addition to this smart meters smart appliances will be there whichcan be automated and they can be ah ah robust in nature they respond to signals from theenergy service provider to avoid using energy during peak times ah this smart appliancesalso include consumer controls to override the automated controls and by overriding theconsumer can consume energy as per their requirement while paying minimum ah that is not ensuredin every home these homes are also equipped with home power generation systems on theroof top there can be these wind turbines which can be fitted or solar panels can befitted to supplement these regular flow of energysurplus energy that is generated by the home ah power management systems can be fed backinto the grid additionally and these consumers can in fact act as service ah you know ahthe energy ah generators and they can in fact ah on some additional money ah ah throughthis particular process and in case of islanding a home can have power from distributed sourcesthat is they can have power home power generation systemsrenewable sources are an important component of smart grid i am not going to to talk aboutwhat is an renewable source the definition is given for you but there are as we all knowfrom our basic knowledge that wind solar and different other forms these sources of energythey are they have lot of advantages in order to reduce environmental pollution so and theseare very attractive and renewable sources of energy are important components of a smartgrid now let us talk about the consumer engagementin a smart grid as i was mentioning briefly before it is possible for the consumers canalso to get engaged in the overall process and the system in the functioning of the systemthat way the consumers can save energy with proper scheduling of smart home appliancespaying less for consuming energy in off peak hours these become advantages to the consumersso consumers get engaged in the process and they get advantaged ah through these meansconsumer involvement comes in different ways timer pricing is one net metering is anotherand financial incentives we are going to talk about each of these in in brief in in timeof use pricing basically what happens the consumers are encouraged to consume energyin the off peak hours when the energy load is less so it benefits both both the serviceprovider as well as the consumers consumers get ah you know during if their ah enjoyingah the power during the off peak hours that way ah you know so they have lower rates ahof ah ah electricity they are paying at lower rates and it also benefits the overall gridthe different other stake holders like the service provider because that way they canmanage the overall load in the city or you know where ever the electricity is being ahis being ah provided ah they can manage it better and throughout the day the energy loadon the grid becomes dynamic so dynamically you know it can be made possibleto use the different consumers they can use the ah the the grid ah the energy load indifferent times of the day in in a dynamic fashion in the on peak hours if the requestedamount of energy is higher it leads to less efficient energy distribution more pollutionand home energy management system basically tries to schedule the smart appliances inthe off peak hours to ensure efficient service and to pay lessnet metering it is one feature through which it is feasible with the installation of itis feasible net metering can be done with the ah with the ah ah with the help of installationof smart meters the consumers are paid high if they are suppling excess amount of generatedenergy to the grid in the on peak hours and the price is less in case of off peak hoursthe final bills to be paid by the consumers depends on the inflow of energy from the gridto the consumer end and the outflow of energy from the consumer end to the grid the consumermay get incentives from the energy service provider at the end of the year based on thenet metering value there are financial incentives as well throughconsumer engagement energy service provider offers some financial incentives to the consumersparticipation incentives can be there for shifting operation of appliances to the offpeak hours incentives can also be provided for using stored energy at the battery installedat the consumer send and at the plug in hybrid electrical vehicles or the plug in electricalvehicles as such smart grid enables consumers engagement to a large extent consumers getfinancial incentives by different means from the energy service provider through this particularprocess with this we come to an end of the first partof the smart grid as we have already seen that vision of smart grid is ah is very attractiveso it basically tries to transform the traditional power grid to a new system new cyber physicalsystem where ict tools are used in a big way and these traditional smart grids can be mademuch more efficient much more secure and much more useful to the consumers and ah so whatwe are going to do is we will continue with our discussions we have already seen someof the components of the smart grid we have seen the smart home and the consumer engagementand there are few other facets of the smart grid and that is what we are going to ah discussin the second part of the smart grid thank you
