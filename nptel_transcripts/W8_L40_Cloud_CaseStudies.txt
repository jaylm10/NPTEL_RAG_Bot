the current lecture on cloud is on some case studies and more specifically case studiesrelated to the available cloud platforms and including the cloud simulation platforms sowe are going to go through some of them so before i start i would like to mention thatyou know before even before the adoption of cloud whether it is for r n d purpose or whetherit is for actual use in a business it is required to assess this particular technology the differentsolutions that are offered by this technology it is required to assess so how can we assessone of the ways is through simulations so there are different simulation platforms thathave been that are made available by different community groups so we can use those in orderto assess how cloud is going to perform what are the different modules what are their implicationson the overall performance of the system and so on so that is a very important aspect ofcloud computing so i will go through some of these differentcloud simulation platforms but before that i would like to ah make you understand someof these issues of simulation so first of all the simulation tools would be requiredto ensure reliability scalability and repeatability for of performance evaluation so you knowwe have to ensure that the system is reliable even before it is used it is scalable andthe data that we are getting you know that is repeatable so we have a repeatable environmentwhich will give you the same or similar kind of data even if you rerun the same simulationover time you know you you know you run in you know at different instants of time youknow you have a repeatable environment which will give you similar kinds of data so thatis very much required for performance evaluation the simulators basically facilitated pre deploymenttests of services then that is basically quite generic as well i mean not just specific tocloud any simulator even mean what a simulator does is even before you deploy the infrastructurethe services is the platform as a whole you need to test how it is going to work so thisis another purpose of the simulator and the third is as the demand of cloud computingis going everyday the simulators and technologies are needed to study how things how differentfeatures which are going to be enabled which are going to be added additionally how theyare going to perform in the cloud environment so cloud simulators allow the customers toevaluate the services to test the services and the platform at no additional cost becauseno additional infrastructure is going to be taken enabling a repeatable evaluation repeatabilityi have already mentioned to you controlling the environment pre detection of issues affectingperformance pre detection means even before actually the cloud is deployed you want topre detect what are the issues that are going to be there which would be affecting the performanceof the cloud environment and that has to be done even before the deployment is going totake place so cloud simulator will help you do that and designing of the countermeasuresin the case of you know the performance degradation due to some issues or you know certain thingsgoing wrong so what are the counter measures that have to be taken and you know designingthat and evaluating those aspects different cloud simulators that are available includecloudsim which is probably one of the most popular you know simulation platforms thatis available in the community cloudanalyst is another one third is green cla ah sorrygreencloud ah next is icancloud the next one is groudsim and the last one is dcsim in thisparticular list so these are some of the some of the cloud simulators that are availablefor use if you want to simulate cloud before actually deploying cloudso cloud sim is a simulation platform as i said before which has different modules whichhas different classes for different cloud computing environments including modules fordata center you know for modeling data centers modules for data center virtual machines applicationsusers network topology so there are different types of modules and their corresponding modelsthat are made available it is cloud sim is based on a java based environment it is writtenon a java based environment that allows to examine the performance of application servicesit is also possible to dynamically add and remove resources in cloudsim and cloudsimwas developed at the university of melbourne by the team led by professor rajkumar buyyahe is very much popular in cloud computing ah and in his lab the clouds lab of the universityof melbourne this cloud sim platform was developed the advantages of cloud sim include takingcare of time effectiveness so cloud based applications implementation has to be donein minimum time with minimum effort so time effectiveness is one second thing is dealingwith fix flexibility and applicability supporting you know the use of diverse cloud environmentsenabling the modeling of application surfaces in any environment these are the some of theadvantages of cloud sim features of cloud sim include i will just read from this listand because these are quite self explanatory i would simply lead them without actuallyneeding to expend them in further detail so features include various cloud computing datacenters different data center network topologies message passing applications virtualizationof server hosts allocation of virtual machines user defined policies for allocation of hostresources to virtual machines energy aware computational resources dynamic addition orremoval of simulation components and stop stop and resumption of simulationso these are some of the features that are supported by cloud sim in the cloud sim architecturewe have different layers the topmost layer is the user code layer which basically presentsthe different machine and application specifications the middle layer is actually the cloud simlayer which provides the actual cloud environment and also enables modeling and simulation ofcloud and the bottom of most layer is known as the core engine core simulation enginelayer and these basically takes care of event scheduling event scheduling means becausewe are dealing with discrete event simulation different events like the creation of thevirtual machine the porting of the virtual machine on the host and so on so these arelike discrete different events so scheduling of the events is taken care of at the bottommostlayer the core engine layer creating these different entities these different virtualmachines the data centers etcetera entity creation is also done at the core engine layerinteraction between the different components the clock management because you know thereis actually a clock class from which you know the the whatever you know entities you ahyou borrow you inherit you know you have to take help of the clock that means the timeah you will be required to be inherited so that these different entities are time synchronizedand overall we have a clock managed solution the top layer basically has different entitiessuch as the users the physical machine the virtual machines the applications and surfacesand scheduling policies so basically i will show you with the help of this particularfigure so what will happens is you have this user code and then you have the simulationspecification and the scheduling policies so simulation ah simulation specificationand the schedu ah you know ah the scheduling policy again breaks into two parts one isthe application configuration which has ah sorry as a application configuration the cloudscenario and the user requirement so this is basically that simulation specificationso this is taking care of by these three different components the cloud scenario user requirementand application configuration the scheduling policy is taken care of by this subcomponentswhich is basically the user broker and the data center broker the middle layer is basicallyah the cloud sim layer which takes care of the creation and simulation of dedicated managementinterfaces issues such as memory management storage bandwidth and virtual machine creationand simulation are taken care of at this layer this particular layer helps in solving issueslike host provisioning to virtual machines application execution management and dynamicsystem state monitoring it allows a cloud service provider to implement customized strategiesevaluating the efficiency of different policies in virtual machine provisioning here is theoverall cloud sim architecture so we have different layers in cloud sim we have theuser interface structure the virtual machine services cloud services cloud resources andnetwork so these are the different components of the cloud sameso user interface structure has two different sub components the cloudlet and the virtualmachine so cloudlet is sort of like a small physical server which which will put the youknow which will create these virtual machines then we have what the virtual machine servicesconstituting the cloudlet execution execution of the cloudlet that is created and the virtualmachine management then we have the cloud services comprising of virtual machine provisioningbandwidth allocation cpu allocation memory allocation and storage allocation then wehave the fourth one which is the cloud resources ah component of the layer which includes eventhandling sensor management data center and the cloud coordinator and then we have thenetwork layer which takes care of the network topology and message delay calculation sothe that was the cloud sim another production another system which works on top of cloudssim is the cloud analyst which is a product that was again developed by the group ledby professor rajkumar buyya so the crowd analyst is a simulation tooldesigned on top of cloud seemed to provide a graphical user interface that will supportgeographically distributed large scale cloud applications the overall purpose of cloudanalyst is to study the behavior of such applications under different deployment configurationsso basically this cloud analyst will have different metrics to trick take care of theperformance of this cloud the different parts of the cloud and so onthe features of cloud analyst include it is easy to use due to the availability of guiit has high level of configurability it has a feature of flexibility of adding differentcomponents repeatability of experiments graphical output provisioning with the help of chartsand tables and easy extend extensibility with the help of java swing and different othertechnologies the cloud analyst architecture is given in front of you in the figure sowe have two main components one is the the cloud sim extensions by offering differentmetrics different you know different extensions that will help you to analyze what is goingon how the cloud is behaving and so on and the graphical user interface so this interactionwith the core cloud sim and the different components the two components of cloud analystare shown in this particular figure so the cloud analyst list basically comeswith different components such as the gui package for front end development the simulationah ah simulation component which basically creates executes and holds virtual machinesthen we have the user base for user traffic generation data center controller internetfor internet working routing networking network provisioning and so on internet characteristicscomponent which basically takes care of properties of the internet with respect to delay bandwidththroughput etcetera the vm load balancer which takes care of issues of policies for loadbalancing and the cloud app service broker which takes care of entities for which hasentities for routing between the user base and the data centerso why do we need green cloud so sorry oh so that was the cloud analyst and now we haveanother cloud simulation platform which is known as the green cloud so why do we needgreen cloud so in green cloud so by the way this green cloud was developed by a team ahof us and europe ah pascal bovry group and semi olokun you know from ah the universityof north dakota and pascal bouvry from university of luxembourg in europe so they together cameup with discrete green cloud platform which is again a packet level simulator which isenergy aware and that basically helps in ah reducing the overall you know energy expensesah with the help of ah energy expenses in the adoption of cloudso why do we need green cloud the computing capacity has increased the cost and operationalexpenses of data centers so energy consumption by data center is the major factor that drivesthe operational expenses so what is green cloud it offers operational cost so operationalcost is the energy utilized by computing and combination communication units within a datacenter and how that is done green cloud basically monitors the energy consumption of the serversthe switches etcetera and it is developed as an extension of ns two packet level networklevel network simulator the features of green cloud are listed overhere i would just read read it out for your convenience so number one feature is thatit is it offers a user friendly graphical interface number two is it is open sourcenext is the facility for monitoring energy consumption of network and devices forth isthat it supports simulation of cloud network components fifth is it supports monitoringof energy consumption of individual components next is that enables improved power managementschemes which is very much important in the context of this particular simulator energyconsumption monitoring and reduction is an important feature that is offered by greencloud and the last one last feature is dynamic management and configuration of devicesso those were the simulators now let us talk about some real commercial and open sourcecloud platforms that are available for use so some examples of opens open source cloudinclude openstack cloudstack eucalyptus and so on commercial cloud platforms include amazonweb services microsoft azure google app engine and so on so now let us look at the open sourcecloud platforms these open source cloud platforms mostly offer infrastructure as a service whereasthe commercial ones offer in addition to infrastructure as a service platform is a service softwareis a service and so on on a subscription basis or that means on a payment basis in termsof security these security issues are implemented by the user that means by the customer atthe user end and commercial clouds these are implemented the security aspects are implementedthe security components are implemented by the service providerso here the type of the cloud is private on premise that means in the facility of theuser the cloud will be installed and so on on premise and the commercial clouds are basicallypublic of premised so these are not available on the campus on the in the institutionalpremises and so on so these have to be available made a these are made available to the publicand these have to be subscribed to over the internet so openstack is one very popularform of a cloud platform ah that can be used so openstack is a collection of open sourcetechnologies that is managed by the openstack foundation it supports vastly scalable cloudsystem it has preconfigured software units different services are available for the usersit considers infrastructure as a service so openstack basically supports ias and not asaas or paas it is easy to use because you know one can easily add new instances andcan ah quickly run different cloud components it provides a platform to create softwareapplications and has been developed it has developed software applications which canbe used by the end users so this is basically the schematic of openstackso we have the common network component which includes a container a storage and virtualmachine so this is basically the common network component then you have these different appsat the users apps layer and then it also connects with the dashboard geographical interfaceand the different monitoring tools are also available through the openstack platform openstackhas different components and features i am not going to go through but as you can seeover here they have different components for computation networking storage you know andso on and so for database etcetera etcetera and they have different names for each ofthem nova neutron cinder glands keystone swift horizon trove etcetera etcetera these differentcomponents have their own different names the features include allowing users to createand deploy virtual machines allowing the setting up of cloud management environment supportingeasy horizontal scaling that means dynamic addition and removal of instances to supportmore users in real time and open source software this is open source software which is freelyaccessible to anyone we along with the source code which can be shared to ah shared in orderto ah share with the community for the deployment and use of this platformmicrosoft azure is available on a payment basis it is not free it ah you know earlierit actually it used to be known as the windows azure it supports infrastructure as a serviceand as and also the platform as a service so infrastructure as a service was also offeredby openstack but not platform as a service so this paid software microsoft azure basicallycomes with the platform as a service in addition to the infrastructure as a service it supportsextensive set of surfaces to quickly create deploy and manage applications there are manymany programming language support and frameworks that are available in this particular ah platformthe azure platform and it is available across a worldwide microsoft managed data centersso these are the different advantages of microsoft azure and here the list of different servicesthat are supported by as your are given in front of you we have support for computingsupport for mobile services storage services data management messaging media services contentdelivery content delivery means that you know something like offering different types ofmedia ah you know etcetera through platforms like youtube and so onso content delivery network ah del developer ah ah you know developer services managementservices and machine learning support as your as a platform as a surface paas platform isprovided to clients to develop and deploy software so this is very important so whenwe talk about platform as a service we are talking about some platform that is offeredfor the development of the software to the clients you know clients get the developmentplatform for use on a ah after makings the paymentsso clients basically focus on application development rather than worrying about thehardware and the infrastructure as your is low cost is less vulnerable to security attacksas claimed by them then it is easy to move on to new tools with the help of azure italso solves the issues related to most of the operating system servers and networksazure as infrastructure as a service the previous one was platform as a service and the nextone is infrastructure as a service ah in this particular module it offers total controlof the operating system and the application stack it has features to access manage andmonitor the data centers and it is ideal for the application where complete control isrequired the next one which is also quite popular isthe ec two amazon platform ec two elastic compute cloud the name says it actually theadvantages of amazon ec two is evident from the name so a web service for users to launchec two is a web service for users to launch and manage the server instances in amazonsdatacenter it provides various apis tools and utilities it has the facility for dynamiccomputation scaling in the aws cloud and it supports paper use billing rather than makinglarge and expensive hardware purchases so amazon has different ah is ec two amazon ectwo has different instances so these instances are of different types for different servingdifferent purposes and their specific names that are given by them in ec two are alsolisted over here so in terms of the operating system ec twobasically supports all operating systems ah in terms of storage it has temporary storagefor local instance ah ah store which is a local instance store and also the amazon elasticblock store the ebs and the third is the simple storage service s three so these are the persistentstorage mechanisms that are available to a in ec two ah then the automated scaling sowhich is basically for horizontal scaling where there are rules and schedules that aregiven and the scaling is going to be on the basis of that there are different availablezones in the data centers that basically increases ah ah fault toleranceso ec two basically comes with the concept of available zones availability zones so inthe availability zone basically it is designed the zones are designed in such a way thatif there is some component that goes down there will be some other component that isgoing to automatically take over so the zones basically at the time of creation basicallyensures that such availability is there so that basically improves the overall faulttolerance in data centers features of ah ah amazon ec two also includefirewall support for firewall rules and securitys overall ah there is predefined protocol portsetcetera ah which has source ip ranges ah supporting different firewall rules and securitymechanisms elastic ip address mapping which basically maps between the ip and the vm ofusers so what you have essentially is one pool which is basically the ip address poolthe other one is the pool of virtual machines that can be created for the user so basicallythis elastic ip addressing will map between the ip addresses and the virtual machine ahah and the corresponding virtual machine amazon cloudwatch cpu disk network resourceutilization monitoring these are some of these functions of cloudwatch then you have theenhanced security mechanisms as features in ec two and the last one that i would liketo mention specifically is the formation you know is the availability of feature for creationof virtual private clouds so which will basically logically separate the private clouds notprivate cloud but it it is sort of like a virtual private cloud so i can install inmy lab a virtual private cloud which will be logically separating ah from the rest ofthe amazon web services cloud and this can be optionally connected to the users own networkso with this we come to the conclusion of this lecture we have gone through two differentaspects of cloud one is the different simulation platforms they are there clouds sim cloudanalyst so on and so forth thereafter we spoke about the actual ah you know cloud platformsthat are available for real deployment so in which again there are two classes of suchkind of tools one is the open source once so ah openstack by open foundation is openstackfoundation is a an example of a open source ah cloud platform the paid ones include amazonec two amazon web services microsoft ah microsoft azure and so on so with this we ah you knowstopped over here with the cloud and ah also in another lecture you will be given somehands on demos some demos with which you can perform some hands on ah ah you know experimentationwith cloud if you have the facilities with you you can you know when we go through theseah different you know steps ah in the next lecture you can also perform the experimentsyourselves with the adequate facilities at your endthank you
