now we come to the second part of smart cities and smart homes in part one we spoke aboutthe need for smart cities the challenges in building smart cities and few of the differentissues with respect to building smart cities so in this particular lecture again we willbe focusing on smart cities and these again you know what ever we will be discussing onsmart cities are also applicable for smart homes as well but we will have you know afocus on smart of home in another lecture but here we are going to discuss some of thetechnical issues behind enabling smart cities some of the technical issuesso let us consider something before we go further we have already seen that we haveall these different components the transport railways schools and etcetera etcetera andlet us say in between we have this population population means the citizens right so allof these things these different components let us say this is transport so transportcomponent has different sensors has different actuators these this is let us say railwayrailways all source has the same other components schools hospitals they all have differentsensors and different other iot devices which generate which generate data which generateand data and this data has different ah you know characteristics with respect to volumethis is gigantic you know huge volumes of data that each of these different componentsthey are generating coming at high velocities has different you know different types ofdata media data you know multimedia data text data and so on and so on and so forth theyare at a these different characteristics of big three vs to five vs to seven vs and thisis something that we spoke about in a previous lecture alreadyso i not going to elaborate on these but what is required is to do some good planning sowhat are you going to do with all this data so you know one possibility is that thesedata can be made available to the population to the citizens but making the data availablejust like that will not help so you have to do some processing so let us say that thatprocessing is also done then you have to you have to fuse these data that are made availablefrom these different sources let us say transportation data and health care data sense from differentpoints made available from these different locations has to be this data have to be fusedtogether in order to give better insight about different things in a smart city so that partis really really challengingso one thing is to deal with this kind of data you know this big data that is comingin real time analyzing you know cleaning up processing analyzing this kind of data inreal time this is one thing but in addition you have to fuse the data that are cross tothat are coming from different sources and that is a highly challenging issue and likethis there are different other issues in the building of smart cities in the previous lecturewe spoke about the overall idea the philosophy behind smart cities but then you have to makeit technically made possible it is not like you know you connect few sensors and thenyou know communication will be zigbee wifi etcetera and then you make the data availableno that data is going to be of limited use to the corresponding users of the stake holdersso that is going to be of limited useso you have to you have to do some better job by fusing the data together and then makingthat kind of fused data which has more in sight which will give more insight ah youknow that will be more useful so let us look ahead and see what we have for us in datafusion so data fusion basically you know you are talking about in a smart city environmentwe are talking about enormous volumes of data that are produced periodically and the challengesinclude making these particular type of data available and so that the incoming largerdata can make more sense can make more sense and with the help of this data from thesedifferent sources the large volumes of data from this different sources different predictionsdifferent analytics should be should be executed so the quality of data precession and theaccuracy basically affects the quality of decision making in this kind of iot basedsmart city environments so data fusion basically enables optimum utilization of this massivelycollected data from different sources across different platformsso multi sensor data fusion is very important which basically combines information frommultiple sensor sources it enhances the ability of the decision making system to include amultitude of variables prior to arriving at a decision this is what i was telling youso it is not like clubbing two data together alone but you considered the different youknow different different issues and considered the different variables that are affectingah ah ah these systems and you know taking all of these into account not just the sensordata taking all of these multitudes of ah you know variables effecting the data ah andaffecting the system together you come with you arrive at a decision and make that decisionmade available not just decision but may be different options and make that decision orthe different options available to the usersso data fusion basically will help you in doing this inferences are drawn from multiplesensor type data and ah these are typically ah you know ah ah qualitative the inferencesare qualitative and ah ah you know these basically are of more insight these are more insightfulthese are more meaning full ah ah than the single sensor type data so these putting thesedifferent types of it ah you know different types of data together and trying some kindof you know arriving at some kind of intelligent decision that is more insightful than theindividual data information fusion generated from multiple heterogeneous sources providesfor better understanding and understanding of the operational surroundingsthe challenges include we are dealing with an environment where the data has lot of imperfectionimperfection due to inherent devices devices like sensors etcetera where there is lot ofuncertainty around the environment there are lot of inaccuracies that can keep in so thereis lot of inaccuracy uncertainty in the data and that basically leads to imperfectionsambiguity is another we are talking about an environment where there are you know datathat that that are collected have lot of different outlets outlet means that there would be somedata points which will be far away from the similar data points in the cluster and therecould be some missing data as wellso a ambiguity in the data can also creep similarity there can be conflicts in datadata that are connected from different sensors about the same thing they might be conflictingthey might be contradicting alignment is like this that it arises when the sensor data framesare converted to a singular frame prior to transmission so that also has to be done youknow so that alignment you know into singular frame that is challenging different othertrivial features for example processing of trivial data features may bring down the accuracyof the whole system and ah these are some of the challenges that have to be talked onwhen you are talking about data fusion in an iot environmentso what are the opportunities so collective data is reaching information and it generatesbetter intelligence better insight compared to the single source data from different individualsensors so putting these data together you know will make you to get better insight soyou know what is the required is to optimally amalgate optimally amalgate means that integrateoptimally integrate the data because you know the more and more you integrate you know itis possible to get more insight but at the same time you know that also has to be donein real time to be you know for that decision to be more meaningso so optimal amalgation of ah amalgamation of data then enhancing the collective informationcontent obtained from multiple low power low precision sensors and enabling ah ah datadata fusion basically ah enables the hiding of critical data sources and the semanticsand that is useful for military applications for medical use cases the different stagesof data fusion include decision level which is basically an ah you know talking aboutan ensemble coming up with an ensemble of decisions then feature level you know thatmeans that the different features you know you fuse with respect to the different futureah features at the feature level the integration is done the fusion is doneso it is basically fusion of information prior to decision making and pixel level is fusionof information at the imaging device level itself ok so at the imaging devices that fusionis done in the device itself and single level basically fusion of information at the sensornode or within the local area network itself the mathematical methods of data fusion includeusing probability based schemes such as bayesian analysis statistics recursive methods ei basedschemes such as artificial neural network machine learning algorithms deep neural networksconvolutional neural networks theory of evidence based ah ah ah you know evidence based schemesfor example ah belief functions taking use of belief functions transferable belief modelsso these are the different mathematical methods that are used in order to come up with theseintelligence from the different data that are ah you know that are secured from thedifferent iot devicesso ai artificial intelligence comes as a big helper in enabling this so you know let usconsider this particular figure so traditionally what happens is you have these different sensorsand the sensor data has to be transmitted over the communication medium and has to beyou know based on that some actuation is going to happen but how how that actuation is goingto be made ah you know made possible is it from one or two of these sensors in a basedon these ah sensor value you are going to actuate or can we do something better so forbetterness betterment what can be done is some kind of decision making has to be donewith the help of intelligence by by adding intelligence between these different sensorsand the actuators we can make things better make things improved so how is that made possiblewith the help of artificial intelligence tools methods algorithms and so onso ai come as a rescuer over here and what ai can do is it can make highly accurate decisionmaking possible between the sensors and the actuators so let us consider the scenarioof decision fusion for autonomous vehicles so for autonomous vehicles like autonomouscars etcetera etcetera they interact a lot with the environment you know when there isa driver less car for instance they need to take help of this different sensors they needto also communicate with ah ah you know the with the satellite with the gps with the helpof technologies such as you know lidar technology for obstruction you know for getting a mapof the obstructions ahead or the ultrasonic sensors can help in even checking some differentobstructions that are ahead of them in a small scale lidar can give a bit bigger picturewhereas ultrasonic sensors can give a small scale picture of what is ahead of the autonomousvehicleso autonomous cars you know they basically are collecting different data from differentsources through different technologies like lidar sensor sensor networks ah you know fromsatellites through gps ah and different cameras ahead of you know in front of them so theyall these different data of different types as you can see are connected and they aresent to the server now you know these data of different types you know individually theydo not make much sense they are of limited help but together can these data be fusedtogether so that the car the autonomous car can get some kind of decision making abouthow it is going to proceed or whether it is going to turn left or right or what it isgoing to do if it if it sees some pedestrians in front then what it is going to do likethis kind of thing is made possible with the help of data fusion ah ah data fusion technologyso all these decision making ah through you know of the data that is connected from thedifferent sources you know that is basically made possible with the help of data fusionsmart parking i already spoke about smart parking in a in the previous lecture but letus dig into this smart parking ah ah little bit further smart parking is very much animportant component now a days we have smart parking solutions in different cities alreadystarted to be deployed so ah in a smart parking environment what happens is you know the userknows ahead of actually going to that particular spot that which of the spots in the citieshave free parking spots right which of these different parking lots have free parking spotsand then accordingly the driver can make a decision about where to go and park the carso smart parking basically shortens the parking search ah parking search time of the driversso basically you know searching for the different parking lots that search time would be ahreduced will be shortened and you know it the parking is going to be made efficientit reduces the traffic congestion reduces the pollution by keeping unnecessarily lingeringvehicles off the road so you know so what would happen is in a smart way you know whereto go and where to park that way it is not going to happen that you are in a queue waitingfor your parking your engine is on you are polluting the environment so in a smart parkingbasically also helps in reducing pollution unnecessarily ah in a city it reduces thefuel consumption and costs as well and these are all actually interlinked so that ah youknow fuel consumption more fuel consumption more pollution more costs are involved ahyou know so like this these are all interlinked increases the urban mobility and the shorterparkings search time results in more parked time and hence more revenueso in a smart parking scenario we are talking about ah you know information collection systemdeployment rather i would start with the system deployment system is deployed informationis collected and the surfaces are disseminated to the end users so these are the differentfunctional layers of smart parking in terms of information collection information is collectedfrom the sensors the individual sensors in the car in the parking lot there are differentparking meters the sensors are networked together so you have the sensor network and also thecrowd sensing crowd sensing basically is from the crowd the from the different sensors inthe mobile force ah in the smart phones for instance you are able to collect the differentdata and these data will help in in decision makingso all these data taking together and fusion of these data will help in decision makingthen we have the system deployment ah with respect to the software system that has tobe developed the information management of the data the e parking ah you know guidancesystem that will help in guiding the vehicle about where to go how to go and ah you knowah and parking the car there ah then the data analytics over all so these are the differentsystem level deployment issues in smart parking service dissemination with respect to dynamicpricing strategizing infrastructure based information infrastructure free informationso infrastructure based and infrastructure free so infrastructure free from the differentsensors you know these are not connected to the regular infrastructure like wifi etceteraetcetera this is infrastructure free infrastructure based means like from the regular internetinfrastructure from the regular city communication infrastructure like wifi and ah ah you knowah ah like three g four g you know the cellular ah networks so on these are all like the infrastructurebased and then infrastructure free is what i just told you with the help of sensors adhoc networks formed out of these different mobile device of different users etceterathen parking choice and vehicular activities these all contribute to the building of ahah services required for smart ah smart parking in terms of information sensing in smart parkingthe sensing can be done from stationary sensors or from mobile sensors stationary sensorslike ah you know if you are collecting the data from stationary sensors you need largenumber of sensors to be deployed at different points which will detect the presence or absenceof ah different vehicles or from mobile sensors where fewer sensors would be required comparedto the case of stationary sensors and these mobile sensors the fewer mobile sensors wouldcollect information along the root when they go byenergy management in smart cities you need energy solutions so energy efficient solutionsit is required to light weight the protocols because you are dealing with a highly resourceconstraint environment and at the same time energy consumption has to be reduced for youknow reasons of greenness environment ah ah and so on so light weight protocols are requiredah it is required to schedule ah the optimization of ah ah you know optimization of energy consumptionand ah then predicting models for energy consumption is another ah important thing then you havethe cloud based approach low power conceivers cognitive management framework these are thedifferent energy efficient solutions for for energy management in smart citiesenergy harvesting solutions would include technique help of ah these ah you know harnessingenergy from these renewable sources of energy such as sun wind heat vibration rf sourcesnow a days people are talking about harvesting energy from radio frequencies as well so fromrf sources harvesting energy from sun wind heat vibration and like this so many differenttypes of ah you know ah sources of energy ambient sources of energy are there and howyou can harness the energy from all of these different sourcesenergy harvesting solutions would include dedicated energy harvesting ah by the deployingdifferent ah ah you know different ah ah sources like like solar panels etcetera you know deployedpre deployed energy sources are intentionally deployed near the iot sources to power theseiot devices for example in our agricultural field closer to the sensor node very closeto the sensor node we have these solar panels and these panel solar panels basically powerthe sensor nodes that we have deployed in our agricultural field ah ah and these sensornodes are basically deploy ah you know were developed in the swan lab of our ah instituteso ah the distance between the device and the source ah the sensitivity of the harvestingcircuit and the environment these basically ah ah are contributors to determining theamount of energy that is harvested so with this we come to an end of the secondpart of the lecture on ah on smart cities here we have mostly covered issues such ashow to handle the data that is received from this different sources we can try to makeinferencing with the help of these standalone sensor data that are received the separateindividual data that are received or is it possible to do better you know it is possibleto do better by fusing the data from the different sources together with the help of intelligenceand so on so ah this is the end of the smart cities part two the ah the next in the nextpart we are going to talk about few other different issues of building ah these smartenvironments and there the focus will be on smart homesthank you
