in the previous lectures on introduction to raspberry pi we have learned about how toconfigure raspberry pi and how to use it along with two bear basic sensors on is killer sensorand the other one a camera sensor so two sensors were used and the basic interfacing was introducedto you in the previous two lectures in this lecture you are going to learn about how tointegrate raspberry pi for ah for enabling iot developmentso ah here you are going to learn about ah ah you know these things in more detail sonot only this lecture but the next ah three lecture i mean this one and the next two lecturesyou are going to lesrn about how to integrate the sensors how to integrate the sensors differenttypes of sensors not just one or two but different types of sensors at the same time then afterthese sensors have collected this data then ah how to ah send the data how to disseminatethe data ah through ah some kind of creation of socket two ah ah ah two a remote serverfor for that processing ah using in the udp protocol ah which is a transport layer protocolsso using udp how to do particular ah this particular thing you are going to learn andthere after you are also going to learn ah in this and the next two lectures about ahyou know ah ah ah about how to visualize the data at the serverso the data is received then we have to visualize the data is received at the server at theserver how to visualize the data this is what we are going to learn ah ah so i and ah misteranandroop mukharji ah your ta is going to taking through ah these few steps for achievingthese things that means the data ah acquisition through these different types of sensors ahthen ah sending ah through the network and ah there after ah you know visualizing thedata at the server hello in this lecture ah this lecture willbe covering three different parts of implementation of iot with raspberry pi so in part one willbe discussing about using raspberry pi to capture data from sensors and making a basicdecision on the basis of capture data to actuate some deviceso first of all ah two recapitulate internet of things basically needs to create an interactiveenvironment and additionally it has a network of devices which are connected together sobringing these two together for this particular topic will get into the hands on so anotherthing regarding sensors ah as of already learnt by now and it has been discussed many timessensors are electronic elements which convert physical quantity into electrical signalsor any measurable quantity into electrical signals and sensors can be primarily analogor digital similarly actuators actuators are electromechanical devices or they can be standalone mechanical devices also and generally theyactuate or convert energy into motion so mainly they are used for providing control motionto other components in a big system so in this a system overview as is as follows sensorand actuator are interfaced with raspberry pi data is read from the sensor the actuatoris controlled according to the reading from the sensor and the actuator ah basically whichis connected to the sensor is being ah controlled from the ah readings and this control mechanismwill be showing a brief decision making loop which can be replaced by additional much higherinversion like machine learning statistical learning or even de planning best methodso for this the following are the system requirements we are again using a dht sensor which as adigital humidity and temperature sensor we are using a four point seven kilo ohm resisterah relay some jumper wires raspberry pi and ah mini fan which we have going to connectto the relay to show the effectiveness of our decision making approachso as you already know this digital humidity and temperature sensor it has got four pinsso generally when you keep it like it is shown in the slide from left to right you numberthe pins one up to four and pin one is generally use for power supply rangers from three pointthree to five volt pin two supplies the data to the process a board to which this sensoris connected pin three is generally kept open and pin four is connected to the groundand this one is called the relay board it is a electromechanical switch so it as gotthree output terminals starting from left to right so in this particular board you cansee there are actually four relays this is a composite board consisting of four differentrelays so you can connect for four different devices to it this single entity is knownas one relay and in electronic we call this a sugar cube relay generally ah you can findsugar cube relays ranging from ah operating voltage as of six volts up to twelve voltsso as you can see there are three terminals corresponding to each relay so from left toright the first terminal is designation no or normally open the middle one is commonand the third terminal is known as nc are normally close now what we are about to attemptis a temperature dependent auto cooling system so for this the primary sensor interface withthe raspberry pi is going to be using dht so we have already discussed and showed dothe demos of how a dht is connected to arduino board as well as the raspberry pi so againjust to recapitulate we connect pin one of the dht sensor to the three point three voltpower supply of raspberry pi we connect pin two of this dht sensor which supplies datato raspberry pi to pin seven and finally we connect pin four of the dht sensors to theground pin on the raspberry pi however it is to be noted for this dht sensorthis follows the bcm configuration of raspberry pi so if you recall raspberry pi has two configurationswe generally discussed with the board configuration these two configurations are board and bcmso board configuration we had discussed in the previous lecture now in this one willbe mainly working ah using this dht sensor in the bcm mode as specified by its manufacturernow additionally the relay interface with the raspberry pi is as follows we connectthe vcc pin of the relay to five volts supply of raspberry pi you connect the ground tothe ground of raspberry pi and the input signal to the relay is assign to pin eleven and anotherpoint to remember is when we are using relay we are not using the bcm mode we are usingthe board mode so this pin number eleven is going to be according to board mode whereasin the previous slide this pin seven is according to bcm mode so these both these modes willbe used simultaneously now try to beginning the program in part ahlike in arduino we install and additional library for this dht sensor similarly forraspberry pi we need to install ah ah in additional library from adafruit which basically suppliedthis sensor so ah we are using this dht twenty two sensor first of all ah in your raspberrypi you need to install your adafruit dht sensor library using the following command ah anda point to remember is since you your using ah python base scripting we are going to implementthe dht python library you may be able to find ah come or cross dht c library dht cplus plus libraries that we have more interested on in the python libraryso the first line is this git clone https you follow this link and you press enter youwill see here raspberry pi it terminal its starts if it is connected to the internetit will start download in this folder if go to the once the download is finished we goto the download at folder by putting in this command cd adafruit underscore python underscoredht because this will be the name of the folder which has been downloaded on your raspberrypi system and ah remember this is not the installation the installation is get to comeso after you go into the directory you install the library by running this command sudo pythonsetup dot py install so once your installation is successful you can easily start creatinga codes for dht using python and raspberry piso we have a sample dht enterprising program with raspberry pi first line starts of withimporting the gpio pins so import r pi dot gpio as gpio then we import the time libraryfor calling in the sleep function which provides delays two hour program and then we importthe adafruit underscore dht library which we previously installed now the gpio modeis initially set as board and warning have been set to false for the adafruit it automaticallytakes the board mode as bcm so we are not explicitly identifying anything so sensorequal to adafruit underscore dht dot am two three two two three zero two so this lineas to be explicitly mentioned according to the documentation provided by the manufacturerand then we just ah printer line to signify whether this sensor have been successfullyinitialized or not and we assigned humidity and temperature values from the adafruit libraryfunction by using read underscore retry and in name this sensor which we initially calledand which is connected to bcm pin four in the next line we print the temperatureand humidity values iteratively ah not a iteratively we print this once but we format it accordingto our needs so this is the code ah which we just showed on the right hand side youcan see the output we created ah python file on the raspberry pi named iotsr dot py onceit is executed it ah gathers data from this sensor and you can see your formatted printline is temp equal to twenty six point one celsius and humidity is sixty five point ninepercent so we can zoom into the hardware circuitrynow as you can see this is your dht sensor itis placed on the breadboard and according to the configuration mentioned previouslyin this slide we have connected the vcc ground and the data pin to the appropriate pins onthe raspberry pi board there are additional component attached will come to those laterbut for now will be focusing on only these three wires the brown wire the red wire andthe black wire so coming back to the programming parti have remotely logged into the raspberry pi systemjust increase the font ah little bit so using this terminal i have actually logged intothe raspberry pi as you can see over here pi at the rate raspberry pi i go into thedirectory i see that i have ah testing file named dht temp dot py lecture on this firstso we give the simple command python dht temp dot py as soon as it is executed is a simplecode to fetch only the temperature readings from the dht sensor so the temperature readingas been read as twenty five point zero degree celsiusnow will look at the iotsr file so we have our iotsr file over here lets open and editorand check whether the contends are the same so we have imported the gpio library we haveimported the time module we have imported the adafruit library we installed we saidthe board mode ok so as have told you before the adafruit dot read retry this thing ispin is on by defaults setting bcm mode so this pin number four is according to bcm modewhereas have connected a relay i will come to that in the consecutive slides have connecteda relay and it is connected to pin eleven according to the board modeok before going furthers we we have not checked our raspberry pi is working fine the dht sensoris working fine we are now connecting the relay part so we connect the relay input pinat pin eleven of the raspberry pi using board mode and we putting the basic decision makingloop that if temperature is greater than twenty you print temperature greater than twentyand it will turn on the relay so it will ah ah fan is connected to the relay so i havejust return fan comma zero that is the fan will be turned on and then it will sleep forfive minutes and then fan will be turned off and output pin will be again set to one otherwiseif temperature is lesser then twenty the fan going to be switched on so on the left handside ah this is the code actually open this code few movements back on the raspberry piconsole and on the right hand side you have this relay board you have this dht sensorconnected to the raspberry pi ok now this connection of the li po with thefan ah sorry the connection of the relay with the fan is as follows we are connecting weare using lithium polymer battery we can use any other battery of sufficient rating sincethe fan we are using ah runs on twelve volt we are using a twelve volt li po battery tooperate the fan the normally open terminal of the relay or the positive terminal is connectedto the positive terminal of the fan in the common terminal of the relay is connectedto positive terminal of battery negative terminal of battery is connected to negative terminalof the fan and when these connections have been made and the connection have been recheckedwe run the iotsr dot py file so the connection will looks something like thisok now lets again log into raspberry pi soonce we execute this file you will see the output that prior to that i like to show youthis is my raspberry pi this was my dht sensor giving me ah humidity and temperature readingsthis is my relay board this is the four channel relay board because you can connect four devicessimultaneously so this one unit is known as a relay this single unit is called a sugarcube relay as you can see it as got three terminals normally open common and normallyclose and we have this small fan over here which is connected to a li po battery threecell li po so again back to the terminal will execute the code nowso as soon as the code is executed it gets the reading of temperature is twenty fivepoint two degree celsius and humidity is almost seventy six percent now the decision makingloop has detected that the temperature is greater than twenty so it turns on the fanand after that after five seconds the fan is turned off so this can be modified themodifying the loop and instead of using a normal fls loop you can go for ah fls loopor a normal rule based decision making we can obviously go for various machine runningbest approaches only condition been that you need a lot of data historical data to predictthe next action so if you again focus on the circuit i liketo show when i run this program again if you pay attention to the fan and it is connectedto this relay board as soon as the program is executed and if the relay is turned onthere will be a light blinking against the corresponding relay to which the fan is connectedto this relay so you see it as detector the temperaturegreater than twenty five the relay as been turned onyou see the fan is now also turned on after five second it will turn off so basic applicationis you can use this for automated cooling systems may be for your pc or may be for yourvarious other systems or ah may be in industrial systems also suppose if the temperature ofa furness gets higher or if a temperature of a particular room or work place gets higheryour fan automatically turns on and the network connected device remotely intimates you thatyour temperature is going high so the fan as been turned onso the outputs have been explode i hope this gave you a bit of learning experience wellcover other things and details in our next slide thank you
