so now we are going to discuss about software defined networking and ah and its use in iotso here we are going to talk about how sdn can help in improving mobile networks specificallyso what we have already discussed in the first part of sdn for iot lecture is that we haveso a sensor networks and software defined networking can be used to improve the performanceof sensor networks so we have different sdn approaches for wsns and different approacheslike ah um sensor open flow soft wsn sdn wise are already available in the literature whichcan be used community can use it if they want to implement ah sensor ah you know sdn forwsns and we have also discussed about how software defined wsn can improve the overallperformance of the network compared to the traditional wsnsso this is what we discussed earlier now we let us talk about the traditional mobile wirelessnetworks there are different problems in these traditional mobile networks and these networkscan be like wifi based networks mobile cellular networks or other mobile networks the problemsare with respect to scalability so you know what happens is each of these nodes in thenetworks if the nodes including the base stations access points etcetera typically they arestati cally over provisioned you know so there is over provisioning in each of the nodesin these networks and they are inflexible to manage the mobile traffic with high demandthey are difficult to manage many times this leads to miss configurations they are inflexiblerequires too much time to introduce a new service as a hardware architecture is inaccessibleand they are cost expensive both in capital expenditure and operational expenditure termsbecause both the capex as well as the opex are very expensive are very high so two thingsare important and this is this information has been adopted from the open network foundationso two things are important when we want to adopt sdn for mobile networks one is the flowtable paradigm of sdn which is well suited for end to end communication over multipletechnologies such as wifi three g four g and so on and so forththe other one is the logically centralized control which is particularly useful for efficientbase station coordination for addressing intercellular interference so we are going to talk abouteach of these in slightly more detail in the next little while other issues which are alsoimportant are path management which concerns basically data that can be routed based onservice requirements without depending on the core routing policies and network virtualizationwhich is about abstracting the physical resources from the network services this helps in providingseamless connectivity and service differentiation among the usersso in a traditional mobile network what happens is when a mobile equipment like this operatesit connects with an ah a base station or an axis point for regular data regular ah youknow data back and forth between it and that access point and this particular node it servesthis particular access point ah sorry this particular user equipment but while it isdoing so it is also getting it may also get affected by interference from another nodeso this red colored arrows basically shows the interference and the blue colored onesbasically shows the regular data transfer data communicationso there is this solution which is this sdwmn it tries to address this particular problemof interference through the help of sdn so here what we see is the architecture of thesoftware defined mobile network and as we can see over here we have an sdn controllerand the virtualized radio resource management unit which basically takes care of interferencewith ah the problem of interference so this particular unit what it does is it takes careof issues such as the signals of enodeb two and the signal of enodeb three they do notaffect each other that means the signal of enodeb two will not affect the signal of enodebthree affect means through interference affecting through interferenceso this is made possible through this virtualized radio resource management unit which has beenproposed in this particular protocol or the solution which is sdwmn and with respect tomobile traffic management there is this unit which is the andsf access network discoveryand service function unit which basically takes care of it and this is done this wayso we have the cellular as well as the wi fi and the mobility so so basically the whathappens is when the user is moving right so the user can get first connected to the regularyou know wi fi access point then you know it might have better connectivity with thecellular network three g four g and so on so basically this particular solution basicallytakes care of it how to interoperate between these different ah different when the whenthe user is moving and is getting connected with ah you know and has different signalsfrom different different device devices from different networks wi fi network three g fourg networks etcetera how it is going to do this switching so the sdn basically comesto a comes to a rescue to solve this particular problem the key benefits of the solution isthat centralized control of devices manufacture by multiple vendors is made possible it ispossible to have higher rate of integration of new services and abstracted network controland management is made possible through this particular solution with that option of sdnin these mobile networks so how so you know when we talk about sdnand in sdn based solution its about rules flow rules and rule placement controller placementand so on so let us now look at how rule placement is made at the access devices in these networksthe challenges that are have to be addressed are that number one the general open flowdoes not support wireless network so you know because it is general open flow doesnt dothat some kind of a modification of the existing open flow is required number two typicallythe users are mobile in nature and the network is highly dynamic third challenge that hasto be addressed with respect to rule placement in these networks is that the frequent changesin rule placement is required and the presence of heterogeneous devices in the network mightis a reality ah in the in these ah ah scenarios so basically you know what happened at thatlast point what it says the last challenge what it says is different types of heterogeneousdevices having different configurations supporting different ah you know vendor specific solutionsand protocols and so on exist in a realistic mobile based ah iot network so how to supportsuch heterogeneous devices in a single platform so these are the challenges that have to beworked upon in order to deal with the rule placement issue so there are different approachesor different solutions that have been proposed for it number one is odin number two is ubiflow and number three is mobi flow odin basically proposes the use of an agent its an agentbased solution agent based architecture so here an agent is placed at the access pointsto communicate with the controller so this is the odin agent and there is the odin masterso we have the odin agent which is placed at the physical devices at the access pointfor example and the odin master which is placed at the controller and now this is this handshaking between the communication between the odin agent and the odin master that istaken care of by this odin protocol so it uses the communication between ah theodin agent and the odin master the corresponding flow diagram the flowchart is shown over herewe do not need to understand in detail but it is given for those who might be interestedto understand it nonetheless and ah so so basically it is a handshaking that goes onbetween this odin agent add the access device and access point and the odin master at thecontroller that makes odin function now let us look at the second solution the ubi flowsolution which was published in infocom very recently two thousand fifteen only two yearsback so here there are two main parts of the solutionone takes care of mobility management and the other one takes care of flow schedulingmobility management takes care of issues such as you know how to have scalable control ofthe access points issues such as fault tolerance that means if some component goes down thenwhat happens you know how how can the network still function and the other one is the flowscheduling which has three parts first is partitioning this entire network into multiplepartitions no fragmenting this entire network into multiple partitions and over here wehave shown those three partitions through three different color shades gray light greenand orange so we have three different partitions shownover here network partitions and after this network partitioning has happened then youknow network matching has to be done so let us say that this particular mobile devicereceives a particular packet so then what it is going to do it is going to perform itis going to execute this network matching ah ah network matching algorithm what thatnetwork matching algorithm is going to do is it is going to check that which of thesenetwork partitions should handle this particular packetso you know so then it will be sent to that particular ah ah partition for further handlingand load balancing basically takes care of it you know so you know how the the networkmatching and load balancing will be done together so the load balancing is going to take careof issues such as that one partition should not get too much loaded while the other partitionis under loaded and so on so this is what the load ah balancing is going to donow let us look at the third solution that i was talking about the mobi flow and thispaper was published in i triple e globecom two thousand sixteen and this is the solutionmobi flow solution was proposed by us in the swain group and the mobility ah so mobi flowbasically ah gives a mobility aware flow flow rule placement for mobile based iot solutionsmobile place based iot systems so let us look at these three scenarios over here so herewe have different nodes s one m one connected to this particular access point m two andp one connecting to another access point and their corresponding flow tables are shownhere the corresponding flows tables corresponding to this particular access point and this particularaccess point of the base station the corresponding flow table is given over here very easy tounderstand this part now let us see let us say that the nodes mone and p one have interchanged their positions let us assume a very simple scenario wherem one and p one have interchanged their positions and the current situation looks like thisso essentially you know what should happen is we will have something like this the anotherflow rule has to be added in the flow table corresponding to this particular access pointand the base station in this particular manner but at the same time we also know that flowtable spaces are very limited so we cannot simply have these flow tablesgrow with the addition of these flow rules so you know what essentially has to be doneis the scenario like this so how can we do it this is what mobi flow talks about so mobiflow gives a proactive rule placement scheme depending on the users movement in the networkand when we talk about such a scheme you know what is very important to has have some kindof prediction of the location of the end users at the next time instant give you the dataof how the user was moving till a particular time instantand then placing the flow rules at the access points which can be associated to the usersbased on the predicted locations location prediction this is done in mobi flow usingsomething known as the order k markov predictor which basically takes the last k th locationinstances to predict the next location and the flow rule placement which basically isa linear programming based solution that is used to select which access point is goingto be the optimal one so for further details the difference of mobi flow was given twothousand sixteen globecom paper and if somebody wants to have more insight about how mobiflow works so one needs to go through that particular paper but i would like to summarizedby giving a ah a summary of the results of comparison between mobi flow and the conventionalsolution so what we have is with respect to messageoverhead and energy consumption mobi flow performs better compared to the conventionalnetwork conventional solution and this is quite evident from these two plots so controlmessage overhead and energy consumption can be minimized significantly using mobi flowcompared to the conventional tool placement schemes so next we have to take care of howto perform rule placement at the backbone network so the existing rule placement schemesfor wired networks can be used over here because most of the backbone networks are have a topologyand the structure the overall architecture is similar to that which exists for wirednetworks so we can use the existing rule placementschemes for wired networks over here as well for the backbone network of iot and the loadbalancing is an important issue due to the dynamic nature of the iot network so dynamicresource allocation can also be integrated so another very important thing that we haveto remember in this particular context is the data center networking so there are twotypes of flows that occur in data center networks so data center networks basically you knowhere we are talking about implementation of data center networks with the help of sdnso typically two different solutions of you adoption of sdn in data center networks sohere we have typically two types of flows that are observed one is the mice flow whichare basically basically you know small small flows and the other one is the elephant flowwhich is basically you know large scale flows where big volumes of data are coming big sizeddata are coming and so on and small flows mice flows where small sized data are comingso here what is suggested is for the mice flow wildcard rules can be placed to dealwith these flows the wildcard rules and for the elephant flows what is required is tohave exact match of the rules so so we need to classify the flows beforeinserting the flow rules at the switches to adequately forward them in the network soif it is an elephant flow you know we have to have exact match if it is a mice flow wewill go for a wildcard match anomaly detection can also be performed in iot network usingsdn or open flow so here you know it is required to monitor the network through open flow todetect any anomaly in the network and which can be done by monitoring each flow in thenetwork it is also possible to collect different port statistics at the different switchesand thereby from these statistics you know anomaly detection techniques can be implementedand different anomalies can be found out now what is required is to experiment withthese wireless networks so what are the different platform that are available so mininet traditionallydid not have any wireless support but recently there is this mininet wifi that is availablewhich can be used to deploy a network support mininet wi fi can help support both wiredand wireless network wired implements the ethernet protocol wireless implements theeight zero two point eleven class of protocols so this is one platform that is availablemininet wifi the other one is the onos platform which can be used to place the controllersonos basically helps in placement of the controller so it helps to solve the controller placementproblem so again to sum up sdn based solutions are useful to deal with different challengespresent in an iot network and in the first part of it we talked about iot in the contextof sensor networks and small power you know small devices small iot devices and in thesecond part we talked about iot in the context of mobile networks mobile devices and so onand we have talked about three different solutions one is the ubi flow mobi flow and the odinthese are the three different solutions that are available recently to support sdn formobile iot networks so there are different issues of interferenceand mobility management which have to be taken care of in these sdn based approaches to ahsdn based approaches to iot so interference is a very common thing a very important problemthat has to be addressed so and mobility as well because mobility is something that occursin any iot network and particularly the mobile based iot networks so with this we come toan end and ah we will stop here ah for the we have understood that how sdn can be usedfor implementing iot networks and making the iot networks much more efficient thank you
