in this lecture which is the third in the series on cloud computing for internet ofthings we are going to specifically focus on issues of service management and securityso we will look at some of the issues with service management and security in this lectureand we will not specifically get too much deep into how to offer the service managementand how to secure the systems that will be basically you know out of the scope of thisintroductory course on internet of things so we will simply try to focus on the issuesthat are there and which have to be taken care of while dealing with cloud computingand particularly more specifically of cloud computing for iotso let us look at some of these different issues so before that we have to be carefulabout few things so when we are talking about cloud computing we are essentially talkingabout service offerings computing services being offered and when we talk about serviceofferings we have to ensure that there is optimal performance that is delivered to theintended customers or the end users and there is on demand whenever there is required theservices are offered in an efficient manner in a virtual environment because as we sawin the previous lectures on cloud computing these are environments which are virtual ahcloud is essentially a virtual environment ah where ah you know computing resources areoffered ah through the through the use or through the help of virtualizationed technologiesso basically the aim is to provide equal importance to desired outcomes of customers through servicemanagement so that the customers are satisfied and so that there you know the customers getthe services in a in an ah in a you know in a ah ah good way ah at no extra cost and withminimum risk so minimum risk means i will give you an example over here cost is understandablebut risk basically refers to that let us say that customer was using some computing resourceand if due to some reason that resource becomes unavailable there should be the risk mitigationtechnique should ensure that there is some additional physical resource which will bemapped to the virtual one that the customer was usingso that provisioning has to be done dynamically and the customer should not feel that somethingwas has had gone wrong and because of which this change happened in the background sobasically it is required to offer different types of services and services including usagemonitoring and billing there should be complete description of clear and complete descriptionof the services that the customer is going to get then issues with respect to availabilityof networks and connectivity and it should be available continuously high availabilityof networks and connectivity should be there there should be ease of access ah to theseresources and ah and it should be managed the services should be managed in such a mannerthat the customer will not be able to ah get any any get any feeling of any under or youknow underperformed computing environment there should be portals for service selectionthere should be service guarantees and rapid fulfillment of resources or decommissioningof resources should be ah should be there and it should be a secure ah environment wheresecurely computing and storage facilities are made available to the users so what isthis service level agreement so service level agreement as per definition is about non functionalrequirements that are expected from the service provider more specifically the cloud serviceprovider and this service level agreement in short in the industry it is known as slathis sla basically is required to provide a roadmap which will give clearly defineddeliverables so this sla will typically describe the qualitythe utility the warranty of services that are expected by the customer so this sla willbe some sort of an agreement and handshaking platform between the service providers andthe customers so that the customers know what level of services the customer is going toget from the service provider accounting and billing which go hand in handare very important so basically based on the resources the use of the resources and theinformation about such an such use it is required to bill the customers it is required to billthe customers and keeping track of this information about the resource resource use which is typicallyin the form of records the customers will be billed and the customers will be havingyou know it they will they will billed based on the accounting records the resource pricesand the billing rules there has to be some rules based on which the customer is goingto be billed maybe this much unit of resource consumption will lead to this much you knowah billing ah ah rate a higher amount will lead to another higher rate and so onso like this there has to be slabs or some billing policy some billing rules which hasto be agreed upon by between the customers and the service provider so accounting recordswhich has to be kept track of which is a core component of the accounting module the resourceprices that means you know what is the unit cost of each of these different resourcesand the billing rules that means what is the policy by which the customer is going to bebilled so all these taken together will be used for billing purposenow traditionally data centers were used or even simple it infrastructure used to be usedin the companies in the organizations now we are talking about replacing such thingsor supplementing such traditional regular it infrastructure based or data center basedplatforms with cloud so we are talking about that so let us compare with respect to differentcriteria now for example with respect to the hardware the traditional data centers usedto use heterogeneous hardware different types of hardware purchase through different meansyou know different groups purchasing and so on and so forth heterogeneous hardware withnetwork computing and remote serverso typically what would happen through a remote environment these remote network environmentthese heterogeneous hardware would get access to a server get access to the server and thatused to be the traditional way of getting access to different computing resources gettingaccess to remote server means like data centers would be hosted remotely and through thishardware and the network environment the users are going to get access to the the serversand computing needs etcetera etcetera that used to be traditional in cloud computingwe are talking about off premise resources with virtually hosted solutions with heterogeneoushardware software and networks everything available on the cloud whenever things arerequired whenever users have requirements they can easily scale up or down the resourcesthe resources are going to be made available to the users as per the requirement througha virtualized platform so there is some difference as you can understandbetween the traditional data centers traditional it infrastructure in the companies and thecloud computing environment there are different other differences as well which we have alreadyunderstood in different perspective in the previous two lectures on cloud computing oneis the differences in resilience and elasticity you know so cloud resources cloud platformsare available ah you know in an elastic manner resilient manner resilience means that somethinggoing wrong users will not have a clue of it you know and it is taken care of the problemis taken care of its resilient to different kinds of failures and so onflexibility and scalability you know you need more resources you just pay for it you havethe resources with you whenever you need automation is understood running costs security securityis very important security is you know ah in in ah the cloud environment you have moresecurity compared to the traditional data center or regular it infrastructure basedenvironment and with respect to running costs i have already explained before so i do notneed to explain further so the running you know so here actually you have running costscompared to the traditional onetime cost or periodic costs in on the traditional datacenter environment so here you have running costs so right so you need you need more resourcesyou pay for it you need even more you pay even more and so on so running costs haveto be taken care of in the cloud computing modelnow the economics of scaling which basically benefits the users enormously ah and the economicsbasically depends on four customer population metrics number one the number of unique customersets number two is the duty cycle of the customer set number three is the relative displacementduty cycle and number four is the load of the customer set so all these basically factorsall these factors basically help in coming up with ideas of economics of scaling thereare different economic incentives for cloud computing lowering the cost behind infrastructureand computing required in the organization then ah you know cap ex free computing youknow cap free computing ah you know exclusively made available to the customers deploymentof projects faster that will foster innovation as well then you know scaling up or down asan when required lower maintenance costs resiliency and redundancysteps in evaluating the database manager so database management is very important youneed to manage the data in the cloud so there are different ways of doing it so will notget into too much of thing but we need to understand the saliency behind this particularissue so it is required to define the type of application that will be served like thedata asset protection business intelligence e commerce etcetera and determine how suitablethese applications are for public and private clouds and the factors that are affectingthe easy deployment process the demands of cloud database management system include efficiencyfault tolerance adaptive adaptivity to heterogeneity operational comfort on encrypted data andkeep and the ability of interfacing with different products and solutionsso this basically is quite you know explicit it is quite understandable each of these sowe do not need to really ah dig into them in further detail so for managing data inthe cloud we need some kind of service like database as a service dbaas we need somethinglike that and that has to be integrated with the cloud platforms like microsoft azure orsql database so sql database basically comes with microsoft azure or with amazon web serviceswith the help of dynamo db relational database service and so on or in the case of googlecloud sql taking help of database as a service like platforms like google app engine datastore clear db database dot com and so onso these are the different platforms database as a service platforms that are availablethrough commercial or open source mechanisms for use with cloud now let us come to theissue of security which is the second part of the lecture and here basically we haveto be careful because when you are talking about cloud you are essentially handling differenttypes of data and not only different types of data this data are going to be stored indifferent servers different platforms which may be geographically distributed withoutthe cloud user even having a clue about what is going on behind the scene where physicallythe data is going to decide the cloud user doesnt know so data security is very importantand overall the security of the cloud platform is very important because otherwise the customerswill have lot of concerns which will affect directly or indirectly their use of cloudservices so the problem is that the user in a cloudplatform would essentially lose control of the information that is available on the publiccloud so concerns more specifically about the loss of data seizing of the account servicetraffic hindrance vulnerability of apis are paramount in the case of cloud and the securityof cloud so these security concerns have to be taken care of in addition to any otherit security issues that you already know so the solution is to have counter security solutionsplatforms apis you know applications software etcetera etcetera which will protect fromtheft leakage of data deletion of data accidentally by providing security policies by providingsecurity policies so security of cloud infrastructure must beimplicitly assured for public or private cloud for services such as saas paas and iaas buildinglevels of viewing evaluating and executing infrastructure security include network levelsecurity host level security and application level security in the case of public cloudwe have to ensure that the small change does not severely affect the network topology andthere has to be proper access control for using resources so this is a network levelissue and that has to be ensured second thing is achieving you know character traits likeconfidentiality and integrity of data in transit to and from cloud service providerso confidentiality of data see as you know that data confidentiality integrity availabilityand non repudiation are very much important issues in the context of security so achievingat the network level achieving confidentiality and integrity of data in transit data flowinginto the cloud and coming out of the cloud has to be insured by the cloud service providerand the security rather the confidentiality and integrity of it availability of internetresources correctly to genuine users from the cloud service provider is another issueof concern at the network layer at the host layer issues particularly at the paas andthe saas level include hiding the host operating system from the end users and ensuring todelegate security responsibilities to the cloud service providers host security at iaaslevel include the objective of securing the allocated hosts with the help of differentsoftware etcetera to ensure that attacks such as the blue pill attack on the hypervisorwhich is a core component of iaas platforms is mitigated or is taken care ofblue pill attack as you may be already aware is a specific type of attack on the hypervisorand hypervisor is what i have already explained in the previous lecture on cloud so hypervisoryou know the virtual machines sit on top of the hypervisor hypervisor is tasked to managethese virtual machines so blue pill attack is a very popular form of attack on the hypervisorand that kind of threat has to be taken care of at the host level at the application levelboth the csp and the customer are responsible for security at the application level so itis you know here specifically the application at the application level not just the cspthe customer also has to take careso if it is a saas provider saas cloud service provider taken care of the security of deliverableapplications is there you know should be their main focus from a security perspective fromfor paas providers security of the paas paas platform that means the platform which isoffered as a service for development its a google app engine kind of environment youknow its security etcetera has to be taken care of and the deployed customer applicationssecurity of the deployed customer applications so that is also another concern at the iaaslevel iaas providers level the application level security is not provided by iaas customersarrange for the security mechanism themselvesso customer has to take care of the security themselves data security has different objectivesand the corresponding issues objectives include confide ensuring confidentiality of the dataintegrity of the data and availability what does confidentiality means that the data shouldbe confidential and should be made available to only the intended stakeholder integritymeans that the data should not be tampered with in between that means when it is flowinginto the cloud or coming out of the cloud and availability means that the data shouldbe made available as per the service level agreement to the intended customers in a securedmannerso that different solutions include you know using identity management techniques encryptionaccess control and so on so there are different aspects of data security data provenance datain transit data at rest data at rest means the data that is used for long term use thatis data at rest i mean which doesnt change to fast and it will be there in the serverfor long term use ah you know in the future and so on data including multi tenancy andthe data lineage so data lineage means data lineage data remanence and ah data provenancethese are the issues with the data ah so data lineage means like from the start ah you knowthe from the source till the data is used you know ensuring the security of it ok andah you know similarly the data remanence basically takes care of that whenever the residual dataetcetera etcetera you know securing that data you know keeping track of the data that basicallyhas to be taken care ofso like these actually these are the different issues of data security so let us first talkabout identity and access management am which is basically a branch of cloud security thatallows the legitimate persons to retrieve the legitimate resources at legitimate timefor legitimate reasons so legitimate persons retrieving legitimate resources at legitimatetime for legitimate reasons reasons is basically the issue the main issue behind identity andaccess management in cloud security here the users the user identities and the access permissionsare instigated caught administered and located recorded by i a m that means the identityand access management module authentication authorization and evaluation of all resourcesare done according to the terms and conditions and the roles of the usersfeatures of this module include single access control interface increased security accesscontrol over resource level improvement of operational efficiency organizations attainingaccess control and operation security using this module and improvement of regulatorycompliance management access control is very important in cloud so service providers haveto take care of it explicitly so access control layers in cloud include cloud access serverlevel access [serveal/service] service level access database access both directly and indirectlydirectly the queries should be sent via web services so taking care of that and vm accessvirtual machine level access access to objects within a virtual machineso the these are the different levels of access and the control of access to these differentlylayers has to be taken care of management of these layers depends on the provider orthe consumer based on the deployment model trust and reputation are very important trustbasically takes care of issue of independent expectancy between two entities for any specificcontext at a given time independent expectancy expectancy between two entities so they haveto trust each other and at the same time hand in hand comes the issue of reputation andreputation is about the belief of an entity entitys standing on the community you knowwhat does the entity have you know what is its reputation in the communityso these are the two different issues that that goes hand in hand so these concepts areneeded by the customer to select appropriate cloud provider so there are different modelsor sorry rather different modes of trust establishment so these include accomplishment of servicelevel agreement so whatever service level agreement exists you know accomplishing itthen application of the audit standards that are out there you know whether the audit standardshave been adequately applied or not measuring and rating and questionnaire for self assessmentso these are the different levels of trust access trust establishment that has to betheirrisk assessment categorization of different assessment methodology formal versus informalprocedures of risk assessment qualitative versus quantitative methods of risk assessmentqualitative means that high risk moderate risk low risk versus quantitative means numericrisk figures consequence versus cause analysis so whether the risk is due to a ah consequenceof something or what is the cause behind the risk and inductive versus deductive techniquesso these are the different categories of risk assessment in cloud authentication in cloudcomputing user authentication so there are different aspects like what where user authenticationprocess which takes care of the user authentication process between the new users and the serviceprovider when during the authentication the properties and the safety of process whichcan be invaded by attacks causing severe damages and where the user authentication is doneat the paas layer and the consequence is threat to authentication process can lead to divulgedivulge divulgation ah divulging of confidential data to a fake userso with this we come to two broad main issues in cloud computing one is taking care of theservice management with the help of slas between the customers and the service providers numbertwo is this issue of security security of infrastructure security of the platform securityof the software and the data security data security is very much important customersdid not know really that where their data is going to reside how the data is going toflow around in the system and that has to be assured to the customer that their datais going to be safe so taking care of measures to ensure that there is enough security ofthe data and the the parties can trust each other ah you know that also has to be ensuredthrough the process of some kind of reputation tracking and ensuring that those reputationmeasures are basically disseminated for you know developing trust between these differentparties so these all these things have to be ensured in order to meaningfully use cloudin a commercial or any any kind of environment thank you
