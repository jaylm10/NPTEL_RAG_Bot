so we now come to the part three the third part of smart cities and smart phones andunlike in the previous two lectures where we focused mostly on smart cities here inthis particular lecture we are going to focus on smart homes so when we talk about smarthomes we are talking about the integration of ict technologies like the once that i mentionedas part of the previous two lectures or even the once that we spoke about throughout inthis course taking help of these different technologies how we can make our home homessmart so let us consider a scenario like this sowe have we have let us say a smart home in a home we have different rooms we have ahyou know let us say let me let me just for simplicity let me just denote these differentrooms here here and so on i am not as you can see i am not very good in these art particularlywhen it comes to three d pictures so let us say that this is a room one this is room twothen you have a kitchen then you have the wash roomso in a smart home you have different you have different sensors that are basicallydeployed in different places then the same time you also have some actuators as welllet us say that these are the different actuators which can be could be even some could be inthe room itself so you have different sensors actuators and different types of other likenfc devices or you know different other iot devices and they talk to each otherso let us consider that ah you know we have in a smart home we have to do something betterso do what letus say that we have to ah you know ah cook something ah in a better mannerso what can be done is you know from from a particular room where we are sitting sofrom that point on there could be some kind of a device which can go and which can ahah which can go to the kitchen you know and from the refrigerator of the kitchen it cantake out something and then you know in kitchen there is a microwave device it is going toput that in the microwave device then it is going to boil it or you know ah ah it is goingto ah ah you know warm up in the micro wave oven and then it is going to serve me rightso this is one example like this you know there are different other things at home differentactivities that we do at home these could also be made smarter so this is an exampleof smart home in smart home you need better health care better health care you know improvedactivity ah ah you know ah improved activity i would say that ah ah you know performingand so on like this you know so whatever regular activities that you do those can also be improvedso that the activities can be done you know efficientlyso going back let us look at the smart home infrastructure so you need these differentinfrastructure these infrastructure as i telling you so far that you have these different sensorsactuators different robotic devices that are there at your home and also you need the networkinginfrastructure so you have intelligent networking device infrastructure there is seem less integrationof this various devices the sensor actuators etcetera using wireless typically wirelessah technologies are used but wire technologes could also be used in additionso this basically allows the ease of use of house hold systems so improving the efficiencyof performing different activities in a smart home or the use of these different house holdsystems can be improved it creates a highly personalized and safe home space so ah youknow whatever i need you know i can do things efficiently you know and why it is efficientbecause let us say that you know if i have run out of the groceries the grocer is goingto be informed so that will make it more efficient so corporations like ah you know ge ciscogoogle microsoft and many others they are seriously thinking about building smart homesystems they are seriously thinking about they are inversing on building smart homesystems so smart home systems have become very popular in the recent yearsso smart home basically provides productive and cost effective ah environment ah becauseyou know if you are doing things efficiently the cost is going to improve ah you know isgoing to reduce so it is going to be cost efficient maximizes theeffectiveness of theoccupants provides efficient management with minimum life time costs of hardware and facilitiesand optimizes things such as structures systems services and management interrelationshipsbetween the above three so all these are going to be optimized in a smart home environmentso ah in a smart home basically the different components are sensor networks sensor sensornetworks intelligent control intelligent management communication network infrastructure and smartfeatures and automatic responses so in a smart home we are typically talking about somethingknown as home area network which is analogous to something like a local area network ina building or couple of buildings together when you you know typically we have theselocal area networks so smart ah sorry and then we have this personal area network sopersonal area network is very much ah like you know small in terms of the range typicallyyou know human bodies have the personal area networks or ah then we can have this personalarea networks out of this different peripheral devices in a computing systemso personal area networks is too small then the local area networks are much bigger thenwe need something in between for use in smart homes and this is known as the home area networkso in a home area network we have different components we have these home area networkelements which which we are going to talk about in more details shortly so the networkis basically content within aparticular home in a ah in a in a home area network then wehave there is different standards ah the architectures ah ah then ah we have the different initiativesso basically you know so we are going to talk about each of these in further detail withrespect to the home area network home area network elements home area network standardshome area network architectures and the different other initiatives we are going to talk aboutshortly so the network is contained within a home it enables the remote access and controlof devices and systems and provides amalgamation of various systems with in a home such assecurity system home automation system personal media communication and so onso let us start with the home area network element the first one is ip protocol so wehave muliti protocol gateway bridges ah the non ip network to ip network in other wordsyou know so you have in a home area network support for both ip based networks the traditionalinternet based networks as well as there are some non ip based networks as well and thereare gateways that would bridge multiprotocol gateway that means support you know thosegateways basically support they understand the language of different protocols both ipbased protocols they understand as well as the non ip based protocols both they understandbridging between new technologies is limited with the help of ah ah you know ah ip basedah ah a thing ip based ah ah protocol and for new technologies or networks a new mappingis required for bridging to perform satisfactorily the next one is the wired home area networkso these basically enables easy integration with p existing house infrastructure likeexisting telephone systems existing cables you know cable television cables and so onso easy integration is possible with the help of this it is low cost because you know youdo not need additional wiring additional infrastructure you know with the help of these existing systemsit can be done and you know this is cheaper but at the same time you know it is it hasyou know different limitations it has different limitations because mobility is one issueso if it is all wired you know you cannot move move around and mobility is very importantyou know where easy ease in mobility is very important in a in a in a smart environmentin any smart environment and in a smart home as well so you know all though wired technologiesin a home area network are less expensive compared to the wireless counterpart but atthe same time it also restricts the mobility of the users at home wireless home area networkuses different technologies like wifi zigbee and the different others that is spoke aboutin this course by earlier part of this course for example the ones that we covered in moduleone the different technologies those can be used for wireless home area network so wirelessmakes implementation easy it improves the mobility of the users there by improve thesatisfaction and the utility of home networks ah you know ah ah ah over all this utilityis going to improve so the classification of home area networksso we have the home area network communication and networking technologies which are wiredor wireless wired would take help of electronic ah sorry electric lines telephone lines opticalfibers that are already existing at home even the ah cable television ah ah cables cabletv cables and so on wireless basically are typically battery operated or they can evenbe better if free and the battery operated there is no energy harvesting in battery freethere is energy harvesting and some of this protocols that basically help in this batteryoperated energy harvested communication in a home area network are given over here sowe have zwave wifi six lowpan zigbee and so on in enocean basically harvests energy andit is battery free wireless technology now thedifferent standards that are supportedwe have the most important one the most popular one the upnp universal plug and play universalplug and play is a protocol standard ah that is used typically in most of the smart environmentsand particularly for building smart homes see universal plug and play is an applicationlayer technology particularly for web based applications it is used so ah the tcpip protocolsstack provides support for the lower layers and enables seamless integration of the varioustechnologies and provides the ah the transparent networking with support for zero configurationnetworking and automatic discovery services then we have the dlna the full form of whichis digital living network alliance dlna it is a trade organization that is created bycompanies like sony intel and microsoft it connects cable based networks with wirelessnetworks for increased sharing of media control and access so cable networks come up withlot of media content sharing those with the help of other wireless networks with the usersso the dlna digital living network alliance basically this helps in this kind of contentbeing made available the media reach content being made available in domestic front ahah for for ah for use by the domestic users at homethen we have this konnex standard in short it is also known as the knx standard whichis an important standard for home and building networks which utilizes the full range ofhome communication infrastructure including power lines coaxial cables twisted pair rfetcetera when ah whatever is existing those existing infrastructure the communicationinfrastructure at utilized in konnex and this must be set up and configured via a softwarebefore its proper usage then we have the lonworks ah local ah operation networks lonworks whereevery device includes a neuron chip you know lonworks has a different devices which includessomething known as the neuron chip which has a transceiver and the application electronicsso then neuron chip is a system on chip with multiple microprocessors ram rom io interfaceports and so on its splits the device groups into intelligent elements which can communicatethrough a physical communication medium then we have ah the zigbee and zigbee we have actuallydiscussed in a lot detail in module one so i am not going to talk about in too much detailhere but from a home area network perspective zigbee is very commonly used it has the differentlayers the physical layer the mac layer the network layer and the application layer asyou already know by virtue of your existing knowledge of zigbee in the module one of thiscourse physical and mac layers in zigbee are definedwith the help of the eight zero two point fifteen point four i triple e standard whereasthe network and application layers are defined by zigbee ah zigbee itself it aims at lowcost low energy devices and there is a zigbee alliance comprising of the companies suchas mitsubishi honeywell invensys motorola and philips so this basically guides the developmentof thezigbee standard forward x ten is another standard that enables remote control of complaintah sorry of compliant transmitters and receivers over power lines and electrical [walley/wirings]wirings that are already present at home it was adapted by ge and philips and this standarddefines the procedures for transmission of bits over se carrier ah alternating carrierah current carrier signals and it has low speed and low data rate and is mainly usedfor control of lighting appliance networks and security sensorsnow let us talk about in brief about the different home area network architectures the home arenetwork architectures two of them are quite popular the first one is the domonet whichuses xml for description and wave services for control follows follows a service orientedbased architecture and it is not tied to any specific type of software language or architecturehere in domonet a central gateway is there which connects different technologies andthere is also a tech manager for each technology that provides a web services for control andaccess then we have this jini architecture that helps in connecting various devices sharingtheir resources with auto configuration and auto installation it is based on the javaenvironment and is perused by the company sunmicrosystems which later one ah ah ah becameah oracle it constructs an organized distribution systemwithout a central node jini jinni applications use ah the byte code and the jvm so this isbasically java environment compliant ah that is the reason actually it is using the jvmand the byte code and are portable because you know it is it is based on the use of jvmand byte code byte code based technologies so where ever this jvm is installed so ahyou know byte code is basically portable technology in java and that is the reason jini is alsovery much portable it follows the object oriented paradigm in terms of the initiatives thereis that hydra project ah which is about some middle ware for embedded intelligent systemsah so that middle ware was ah ah you know was ah um was proposed ah a for ah a use iniot kind of environments where there are embedded intelligent systems or intelligent devicesit connects a service oriented architecture network ah the connected devices may havelimited resources low processing power memory or energy consumption here in hydra each devicehas an embedded hydra client which acts as a proxy between the device and the middleware so in the hydra protocol stack there are thesedifferent ah there are different layers we have ah at the very bottom we have the physicallayer you know having bluetooth zigbee wireless local area networks and so on on top we havethe operating system comprising of tinyos windows etcetera so tinyos is an operatingsystem of window as of sensors so it is commonly used along with the sensors so tinyos operatingsystem then we have the hydra middleware and then we have this applications in the hydramiddle ware we have this application elements and the device elements and they basicallyhandset with respect to this different three layers the network layer the service layerand the semantic layer and there is a vertically cutting across security layer ah in hydraso this is how the overall hydra protocol stack looks like and then comes the ah theother ah you know architecture which is the amigo architecture ah sorry amigo initiativenot architecture the amigo initiative which is aimed at ambient intelligence systems fornetworked home ah environments ah amigo basically features user friendly interfaces it takescare of interoperability and also the issues of automatic discovery of devices and serviceswhich are very important in iot environments particularly when we are talking about homearea networks home users and home ah ah you know ah smart homesso with this we come to an end of ah this lecture specifically focusing on smart homeswe have seen the different protocols that are used in smart homes the different architecturesof smart homes and also the different initiatives the hydra and the amigo initiatives ah ahthat use ah ah that that arethat have that these initiatives are therefor building smarthomes thank you
