so far in the previous lectures we talked about networks which are going to operateon the ground typically but it is also possible for networks to be formed out of flying objectsso we have flying networks so these flying objects could be different things like thethese could be aeroplanes helicopters you know several helicopters internetwork togetheror few small small planes which could be internetwork together or now a days we have these uavsor drones more popular are the quad copters these quad copters could be acting as theseflying objects and if we have a several such quad copters flying together we can internetworkthem we can network them together so that they can communicate between themselvesand they can go about accomplishing some missions and this particular this particularly is verymuch attractive for different types of applications civilian applications and particularly formilitary applications this is very very important for example is form of uavs a network of uavscould be going and accomplishing some task across the border maybe performing some recognizea survey between two countries border bordering two countries rightso in the borders the swarm of uavs can go and it can surveyed similarly if there issome kind of a disaster post disaster you know taking stock of the situation a swarmof uavs can go take stock of the situations maybe through their cameras or whatever andcome back so they have to interconnect they have to talk to each other and then send thatsensed ah sensed or you know collected information to the ground station this is done using somethingknown as the uav network so in plain and basic terms uav network isa network of uavs so quad copters for example or drones more generally can be internetworktogether to form uav networks so there are different features of uav networks so firstthing is the topology so we are talking about a network which is highly dynamic the topologyis fast changing very fast changing compared to this you know the terrestrial networkscompared to the terrestrial or ground networks the the because these are flying objects andthey fly at very high speeds the topology itself will be changing very fast and thenetwork itself will be moving together ok and consequently the dynamic dynamism in thetopology is going to be very much so there are two types of popular topologiesthat are used to have to model uav networks one is known as the star topology i will showyou what is the meaning of star topology and then we can have a mesh topology which isattractive in the sense that you know mesh basically mesh kind of topology for any networkensures reliability and fault tolerance so mesh networks are very ah ah very attractiveand but at the same time star topology is more common and are easily deployable thenthe second feature is the flexible deployment and management of new services using sdnso now a days people are talking about using sdn to manage uav networks for deploying ahah flexibly deploying and managing different services the routing protocols should be adaptivein nature should contribute towards ah greening of the network and multi tasking multi taskingis a very important feature so these nodes you know so these flying nodes these quadcopters for example in a uav network they could be doing different things together theyhave to do different things together and that is a very important feature of uav networkthen ah another very important feature of uav network is that you can cover you canoffer connectivity over a larger area so you can have larger coverage of connectivity orsensing coverage also can be expanded with the help of uav networks because these arefast moving flying networks comprising of different flying nodes so this could be easilyconfigure reconfigurable for varying missions so depending on the mission these networkscan be you know programmed ah or predefined or reconfigured or preconfigured in differentways so the key issues here are that we are dealingwith a different type of network where the topology is going to frequently change veryfrequently change then the relative position of the uavs may also change very frequentlybecause within a group these nodes are going to change their positions pretty fast so wehave a network where not only the network is moving very fast could be moving very fastbut also these nodes in that particular network they could also be changing their positionspretty fast then the third feature is malfunctioning ifthere is some malfunctioning in the network if there is some malfunctioning in the networkmaybe a particular node you know the hardware has failed it doesnt fly any any further thenthese networks are developed in such a way that they can still continue to function theycan still continue to function in the presence of malfunctioning they will reform the networkthe topology is going to be reformed the topology is going to be changed and they are goingto function and the next one is intermittent link ah nature which means that because thistopology is changing because the internal node positioning is going to change dynamicallyover time the links are going to be also changed you know so so two nodes they might be linkedup at one instant of time then with one of these nodes another link might be set up inanother in a instant of time and so on so intermittent link connectivity intermittentconnectivity sometimes these links might be ah you know these nodes might be able to communicateover a particular link at a few other instance they may not be able to communicate over thelinks and so on so intermittent link connectivity and lack of suitable routing algorithm isanother feature so ah basically you know what happens is ah because it is a highly dynamicdifferent kind of network that routing algorithms like aodv dsr etcetera etcetera that are availablefor ground ad hoc networks or ground terrestrial sensor networks are not usable per se in thesekind of networks which are highly dynamic much more highly dynamic than even manetsmobile ad hoc networks here are some of the considerations in uavnetwork we have a single uav system and we have a multi uav system failures single uavsystem the chances are high in a multi uav system the chances of failure are low failureof the system as a whole we are talking about failure of the system as a whole and thisis quite obvious the scalability is limited in a single uav system in a multi uav systemah you know it is highly scalable ah because if you if you increase the few nodes you knowthe node ah the basically the network can be expanded further then we have the speedof mission in a single uav system the speed is slow but in a multi uav system the speedof mission is fast survivability is poor in a single uav systemsurvivability in a multi uav system is higher the ah cost in a single uav system the costis medium cost because you are dealing with a single uav and in a multi uav system thecost is medium because you are dealing with ah sorry the cost is high because you aredealing with ah um a multiple uavs in terms of the bandwidth requirement the bandwidthrequirement over here is high whereas when a multi uav system the bandwidth requirementis medium in a in the case of antennas the antennas over here are omni directional whereasin multi uav system the antennas are directional in terms of the complexity of control it islow in a single uav system but high in multi uav systemin terms of the failure to coordinate low in a single uav system and in a multi uavsystem it is present so there are different constraints on these uav networks we havefrequent link breakages due to the high degrees of dynamism that i just mentioned these networksare prone to malfunctioning due to one or more nodes failing and this is quite possiblein these flying networks then we have huge power requirements because you know thesenodes are like you know high powered you know these nodes they have to fly and they haveto again carry some payload and then they have to communicateso all these basically increase the power requirements per node these networks thatare formed are quite complex very complex networks because of these all these dynamismsand the complexity of ah changing topology mode position link breakages and makages andso on then ah ah ah then ah ah physically these nodes are physically prone to environmentaleffects with respect to wins rain etcetera because they operate in such kind of environmentwhere they are they are they ah they are susceptible to environmental effectsthe advantages of uav networks include high reliability because you know instead of asingle uav if we are talking about several uavs that improve in that improves the reliabilityof the system high survivability is another important feature single mal function proofah you know if single node malfunctions you know uav network are not going to get affectedwhere is the single uav systems are going to get affected cost effectiveness ah youknow ah in fact you know unlike what would normally ah be believed you know these networksuav networks are cost effective cost effective because you know so what happens essentiallyis i mean although initially you we are going to buy couple of these uavs not one but theycan you know accomplish a mission much more efficiently compared to a single uavsso that way basically the cost is ah you know the efficiency with respect to cost is improvedin a uav network efficiency overall of the network improves in a uav network system andthe missions can be speeded up you know so the time that it takes for accomplishing aparticular mission that gets speeded up in uav networks so if you recall that initiallywe were discussing about the different topologies of uav networks so we will start with thestar topology so there are two types of topologies in star one is the basic star and where wehave this ground station and these different uavs basically connected directly to thisground station to form a star topology then we have the multi star topology wherebasically you know this particular unit is repeated and so we have one star two starsthree stars and four star four star topology you know four stars all connected to you knowfour four of these starts call connected to the ground station in a mesh topology a meshkind of topology is formed and one of these nodes in this mesh is going to connect tothe ground station like this so we have this unit of the mesh and this is repeated andthis kind of architecture this kind of topology is obviously quite scalableso when we compare the star topology and the mesh topology star topology is point to pointcommunication in the mesh topology we have multi point to multi point communication thenwe have the central control point present in a star topology whereas it is infrastructurebased may have a control center and ad hoc has no central control center so basicallyyou know if it is infrastructure based it may have a control center whereas if it isa adopt based then there is no control center in the mesh networkit is infrastructure based in the star network whereas it is infrastructure based or ad hocin the mesh network likewise actually there are other properties that differentiate thestar topology with the mesh topology i am not going to go through them ah further butit is given to you in this particular table for you to go through so essentially whatwe are talking about is something like a flying network so ad hoc networks on the ground wehave already we know how they work so there is no centralized coordinator there is nonetwork manager the nodes they come together they self organize self configure and thenthey start working now imagine that that ground ad hoc network is brought up to to flyso then what we have is a flying ad hoc network and this flying ad hoc network is known inshort as fanets on the contrary the ground based ah ah ad hoc networks are known as mobilead hoc networks so we have this network formation done using uavs which ensure longer rangeclearer line of sight propagation and environment resilient communication and these uavs maybein some plane or are organized at different altitudes like shown over hereso like these three uavs are in the same plane these three uavs are in another plane andthese this uav is another plane so as we can see that they are they are in three differentplanes with three different altitudes but these uavs in a single plane they are theyare in that same plane so besides self control each uav must be aware of the other flyingnodes of the flying ad hoc network to avoid collision because if that information is notknown then it might so happen that you know there might be chances of physical collisionbetween the different nodes of the same network so this sort of network topology flying adhoc networks is popular for applications such as disaster monitoring post disaster monitoringemergency network establishment and so on flying ad hoc networks basically the communicationtakes place in different planes one is inter plane communication so inter plane communicationmeans that so as we can see in this particular figure we have one plane we have second planewe have a third plane inter plane communication basically takes clear ah you know takes intoaccount how the uav of one plane communicates with uav of another planeso inter plane communication then we have intra plane communication like within thesame plane these uavs communicating with each other is inter plane communication groundstation communication from a uav in one of these planes to the ground station is groundstation communication ground sensor communication likewise in sensor communication ah with theground and then we have fanet vanet communication so ah fanet is ah this one ah that we arediscussing about now these could be connected to vehicular ad hoc networks on the groundthe vanets on the ground so flying ad hoc networks vehicular ad hocnetworks can be connected together to to be able to communicate so we have different typesof links we have the air to air links for data delivery among the uavs then we haveheterogeneous radio interfaces ah in the a to a links using zigbee pro following eightzero two point fifteen point four standard or using wi fi eight zero two point elevenstandard the ground networks may be stationary sensor networks or vanets or contour stationsand the uav wsn ah link up may be used for collaborative sensing as well as data mulingthe main communication requirement of uav networks are sending back of the sensor datadeceiving the control commands cooperative trajection trajectory planning and dynamicah a task assignments so in this particular figure as we can seeover here we have a bunch of different uavs maybe working in a plane functioning in aplane and then we have one of these nodes which is designated as the gateway which actsas a coordinator with all the other nodes in the same plane so inter uav network coveragearea will be divided into sub areas as shown over here so this particular coverage areais divided into sub areas like this this this this and this and the sub areas collectivelycovered the entire communication area the size of a sub area to be controlled and adjustis to be controlled and adjusted dynamically and these adjustments are based on uav interconnectionsand derived matrix the derived matrix are optimized for several iterations till optimaland the till the optimal state is achieved so how do you select the gateway the gatewayselection is initiated by the selection of the most stable node in a particular sub areaso in a particular sub area the most stable node is considered that must ah consecutivelythe partition parameters are optimized according to the topology where each uav acquires theinformation of all uavs within its two hops so flying ad hoc networks and vehicular adhoc networks as you can see over here there is a link up so this is the flying ad hocnetworks with a to a link etcetera etcetera and then we have this v to v link over herein the vehicular network and then here this connectivity shows the a to v link where itis basically air to vehicle link so meshed kind of network can be formed ina particular ah ah particular ah um ah plane and ah then ah there can be different linksah between the uav network and the ground vehicle between the ground vehicle and ahanother flying node and ah ah so on and so forth so like this actually ah the differenttypes of communication are going to take place so the trajectory control for increasing thethroughput how the trajectory is going to be controlled in order to improve the overallthroughput so typically what happens is uavs with queueoccupancy above a threshold experience condition resulting in communication delay the controlstation instructs the uavs to change the centers of trajectory and the command is given basedon the traffic at the busy communication link so as we can see over here in this figurewe see that ah this is a grid like deployment of the uavs and the buffer occupancy or thequeue queue occupancy are also shown in this green green and red colored ah nodes ah ahgreat not nodes but these grid colors ah green colored and red colored symbolsand then ah on the other hand we see that if ah a particular node like ah this nodeah will do its dynamism it has moved twenty meters for example then we see that thesethings have to be handled this has to be handled this buffer occupancy of ninety and fiftyah has to be ah has to be handled so with this we come to an end of ah the lectureson uav networks and i will tell you that ah uav networks are very important they havelot of attractive applications military particularly all over the world they are they their potentialah ah customers of uavs and uav networks and ah um these uav networks are ah quite ah popularah and are ah bit ah difficult to implement as well and ah so we have understood the basicconcepts for developing ah developing these uav networks and there is lot of researchthat is going on on uav networks on different other aspects thank you
