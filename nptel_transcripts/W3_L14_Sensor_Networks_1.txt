now a very interesting series of lectures we are going to have it is on sensor networksso the first part is going to be on some of the basic concepts in sensor networks sensornetworks is a very very important technology that is used for building iot sensors transducersactuators these are all very important things for realization realization of iot systemsbut when we talk about sensors when we talk about actuators these are the things thatwe have already gone through in one of the previous lectures so these are stand alonedevices that we talk about but if we can have these sensors connect with one an anotherwe can derive important information continuously in real time remotely from a larger terrainand this is the benefit of sensor network and sensor network i would say is one of themost important enablers of iotso in sensor networks what we have in sensor networks we have individual sensors whichare embedded in something known as sensor devices or sensor nodes or sometimes alsoknown as sensor modes so these modes or nodes or devices they have one of their componentswhich is the sensor and they have other components as well so these components taken togetherthey comprise that particular node or the device which can help them to communicateand one device communicates with another device that device communicates with another devicethe third device with a fourth fourth with the first and so on and so so so we can expandwe can expand the sensing we can expand the sensing by having them communicate with oneanother so what we have are different types of topologieswe can have all sorts of topologies that we have already heard of in networks being implementedin the case of sensor networks as well we can use a star topology we can use a meshtopology we can have a mesh of we can have a mesh of sensor nodes that are all put togetherright so we can have star we can have ring we can have you know any kind of topologythat you can think of and mesh is particularly very attractive for obvious reasons that basicallyincludes reliability security fault tolerance of the topology itselfso let us look at the different basics of sensor networks so in a sensor network wehave sensor nodes every sensor node has a sensing unit the sensing unit basically sensessenses what senses the particular physical phenomena that it is supposed to sense a temperaturesensor would be sensing the temperature fluctuations a humidity sensor will be sensing the humidityfluctuations a camera sensor would be sensing that means taking the images of what is [around/around]around ah you know what is happening around it a vibration sensor will be sensing thevibration a light sensor will be looking at will be sensing the illumination conditionsand so on but each of them is sensing locally and every other node that is deployed theyare all doing their own tasks separately individually and now in a sensor network we all have towe have to put them all together we have to put them all together how it is possible toput them together we have to just have some kind of radio connectivity between these differentdevices these devices means their sensor nodes and this is how we build up a sensor networkand what is the main motivation of building a sensor network to have greater coverageof sensing and continuously we can monitor in real time we can monitor remotely we canmonitor what is going on in a particular terrain without actually having somebody humanly sittingand monitoring that particular region or spaceso the sensor nodes are capable of collaborating with one another and measuring the conditionof the physical phenomena that are occurring around them with respect to what into whatthey are supposed to sense for example the lighting condition temperature sound vibrationetcetera etcetera the sense measurements are then transformed into digital signals andprocess to reveal some properties of the phenomena that are occurring around them so due to thefact that the sensor nodes in sense wsns wireless sensor networks have short transmission rangeimmediate nodes act as intermediate relays and they transmit the data that they receivefrom these other frame nodes the other neighboring nodes in a multi hop manner until the datais received at the sink nodeso this is how the entire sensor network concept functions so what we have is multi hop communicationso let us consider a stationary sensor network stationary means what stationary means thatthe node all these nodes when they are deployed they will maintain the position at subsequentinstants of time after deployment so they will all maintain their own respective positionsand they will not move they are all stationary the nodes are all stationary so this is anexample of a stationary sensor network mobile sensor network on the contrary have the sensorsand the sensor nodes that move around like thisso for example the sensors that are fitted to a car to an airplane to a truck to a busand so on these become mobile sensors mobile sensor nodes because they are fitted to deviceswhich move with time so they become you know together when you connect them in this mannerwhat you get is a mobile sensor network so if we look at in a sensor network what wehave in a sensor network we have different units so wsn we have different unitsso the first thing that is required is to have some kind of sensing unit then we havesome kind of a processing unit third is we need some kind of communication to take placebetween these different nodes so we have a communication unit you with the help of transceiverdevices then we have different other units such as the analog digital converter we havethe power unit we have power unit will do what are in it includes things such as batteryand so on so which is going to power these devices so these are the different units andthen we have other optional units optional units such as the location finding systemsfor example gps etceteraso this is how a sensor node looks like so we have you know in all these optional unitsoptional unit one optional unit two etcetera etcetera we have a processor we have a communicationunit we have analog digital converter we have a power unit we have ah what did i miss outa sensing unit a processing unit it is already given and so on and so forth this is how asensor node looks like so if you recall in one of the previous lectures when we talkedabout sensors we also talked about the different types of sensors so what happens is you knowwe have to develop something like a sensor board so this becomes a sensor board or asensor node or a sensor deviceso this sensor board the hardware of it has different components all these different componentsthat i just mentioned all these different components are basically built into this hardwaredevice so you need to have a particular circuit design for building these sensor nodes withthese different components so essentially what are we trying to do we are trying tohave so let us say the this is one such sensor node communicating with another sensor nodewith another sensor node with another sensor node sorry with another sensor node and rightso we are going to form a sensor network so what i these are all sensors these are allsensors sensor nodes so mind you that in every sensor node we have a sensing unit and sensingunit has the sensor that we are so temperature sensor is basically built into that sensingunit of that sensor board so then what happens so through a multi hoppath all these sensed information are sent to the sink node or the gateway or this routerfor further dissemination to the internet so then what happens is finally all this sensedinformation they will all go through the sink to the internet for further use this is thewhole purpose of this sensor node so this is these are some of the pictures of sensornodes as you can see in this particular figure so this is one such figure one such sensornode here is another sensor node i will show you a sensor node that we have basically deployedfor different purposes one of one such purpose is for ah agriculture in our agriculturalfield we have sensor nodes that are deployed and these are all solar poweredso these are solar powered you know sensor nodes so the power unit basically has a batterywhich basically hardnesses not battery but you know it basically hardnesses the solarenergy through the solar panel and powers the rest of the components of the node thesensor nodes are multifunctional ok so they can be used for different purposes in factthe sensor board you know you can change different sensors and you can use the sensor board thedifferent components of it put together you can remove the sensor you can put anothersensor and typically you know it will work for serving different types of applicationsso the number of sensor nodes that are used depends on the application type the sensornodes they have short communication range may be powered by zigbee a zigbee has veryshort communication range so this short communication range means that the sensed information bya particular node can be sent only up to couple of meters or tens of meters and after thatwhat finally it has to be sent to the sink node so after that what after that withinthat communication range of let us say thirty meters if it is zigbee up to above thirtymeters then we need to have another node which again has to relay that information that hasbeen received from this particular node this is how we have this multi hop communicationtaking place between these different nodes in the network multi hop multi hop means whata particular node has to send something to a remote destination but it is not withinthe direct communication range of it so what it will do is it will send to some of itsneighbors these neighbors will relay the information or the data the sense data that has been receivedand send forward and this is this process is going to continue until the data is receivedat the at the intended destination nodes or the sink node so this is multi hop not singlehop so source node to the sink sink node sink node not within the communication range ofthe source node there has to be intermediate nodes acting as relays and this is the wholeidea of multi hop communication in sensor networksthese sensor nodes i should also mention that these sensor nodes are all not only batterypowered but they act as mini computing devices so they have their own processors and we havealready seen that processors microcontrollers and so on they have their own they have theirown power unit they have their own communication unit plus they have their own operating systemone such very popular operating system that is used for sensor nodes is known as the tinyoperating system tiny os ok so these are the different features and ahnow let us look at the different constants on the sensor node so the sensor nodes aretypically small in size low powered resource constraint in all different ways althoughthey are acting as small size computational devices but they are heavily resource constrainedin all different ways that you can think of so due to their small size typically in theorder of few cubic centimeters or even they can be little bigger also if it is not a mainsbased sensor so because of the small size they must consume extremely low power theymust operate in an unattended manner in a highly dense area should they should be producedusing low cost at low cost production costs should be less and they should be easily dispensablethey should be like couple of dollars few hundred rupees and so on this would be autonomousthey should be able to operate on their own and be adaptive to the environment in whichthey are operating so if there is some change in the environment this should be able toyou know automatically this would be able to adapt to those changeshere a few examples of sensor nodes soil sensor node temperature sensor node weather sensornode and so on all deployed in real life and for serving different applications such astemperature measurement humidity level condition measurement lighting condition air pressuresoil makeup noise level vibrations and so onnow let us look at few important concepts in sensor network so we have seen that insensor networks we have different sensor nodes that a deployed in a particular region thesensor nodes they have to communicate via multi hop communication so let us say thatwe have a surveillance kind of application and where it is required to detect objectsso as we can see in this particular figure that the sensor node seventeen detects a humanobject and that information through this multi hop path is sent to the sink node fourteenand there is a monitor a user who is continuously monitoring that where it can see you knowclose to which sensor it can see any object any human object or whatever object it isprogrammed to sense so as we can see in this particular figurethat node number seventeen has seen has sensed a particular object the human object now itis going to send the data in this particular direction as we have already seen but thenwhy is this arrow shown in the other direction these arrows are shown in the other directionto signify that from this sink a query can be sent to all the nodes the query can besent to all the nodes to see that whether any of them has observed any object aroundthem so this is the direction in the other way that is shown that is the whole purposeof showing it in that particular other direction so the previous example was for a single sourcedetecting a single object now let us make our life little bit more complicatedso we have single source detecting multiple objects so like this so earlier there wasonly human object now we have two more objects so we have a vehicle and we also have someother building or something like that so we have three different objects a human a vehicleand a building so now you as we can see over here it becomes very difficult for this particularnode to recognize that what are the different objects so because there are there is notnot a single object but three different types of objects and what object so object recognitionis also very important so here in addition to object recognition the complexity is thatwhether node number seventeen will ah will ah ah will think that it can see only a singleobject or three different objects this is something that has to be decided upon so yousee that by adding few objects only within the periphery of within the vicinity of asingle node the life has become so complexso so this is the whole idea behind the use of sensor networks for this thing but we haveseen that by adding few complexities the entire complexity of the entire network increasesmanifold now we see another scenario of multiple sourcedetecting a single object so here the single object is a vehicle and all these blue colorednodes they all act as sources and they sent that sends information to the sink node nowthe sink node and the user that is connected to the sink the complexity now is that itwill try to understand that whether all these five nodes have seen a single object thatmeans a car a vehicle or five different objects how will it no it is not possible it is difficultto basically ah a discriminate between these sense data that are received from five differentnodes and that is the reason why it is not possible to know that what is the differencei mean whether it is the same object that is this you know that is all seen by the althoughall the five nodes or five different objects another example of multiple sources detectingmultiple objects like in this particular figure and here again you see that complexity isquite ah [in/increased] increased so these five sources whether they have detectedfive different objects or the same object and not only that but also whether these objectsare all different so these are the different complexities that are involved in implementingsensor networks but these are only some of the primitive complexities that we are talkingabout there are so many different other sorts of complexities that also have to be workedupon that also have to be implemented when we are talking about using sensor networksto build internet of things this is another scenario and i do not need to explain thisfurther and as we have seen that this basically you know these scenarios of surveillance basicallycomplicates our life its not very simple and here mind you that in all these four fivescenarios that i have just shown you here we have considered that the nodes are allstatic and with respect to time but in reality it is not going to happen the nodes are goingto move around so what is going to happen the complexityis going to be even increased further so there are different challenges in implementing sensornetworks scalability is one scalability means that if you are increasing the number of nodesin the network then how is the throughput going to behave so theoretically in the pastit has been shown that if n denotes the number of nodes in the network then the throughputbasically decreases at the rate of one over square root of n and this is as we can understandthat from two nodes to four nodes if we increase the throughput basically goes down drasticallynow from four to eight eight to sixteen and so on and so forth the throughput decreasesquite fast so how you are going to handle the issue of scalability in sensor networksbecause in sensor networks we are inherently talking about networks with large number ofnodes and so how do we handle the throughput decrease in this particular mannersecond issue is quality of service quality of service guarantees is required for anynetwork sensor networks iot using sensor networks also you know need to have seen you know qualityof service guarantees quality of service guarantees talks about offering guarantees in terms ofthe bandwidth delay jitter packet loss probability and so on and so forth and in a sensor networkwe are talking about very limited bandwidth heavily constraint network with heavily constantresources unpredictable changes in rf channel characteristics and so on so in such kindof chaotic environment how we are going to offer deliver quality of service guaranteesother challenges include energy efficiency we are talking about very limited batterypower small size batteries low electrochemical efficiency limited battery power how we aregoing to have these nodes not only function their own things but also cooperated cooperatewith the other nodes the neighbors to relay their information and so on and so forth securityis also very important we are talking about an open medium where the nodes are prone todifferent types of attacks malicious attacks infiltration eavesdropping interference andso onnow let us look at little bit more you know glittering kind of technological concept insensor network which is known as the sensor web in sensor web what we are talking aboutis not just the sensor networks but also sensor networks connected to sensor networks ah sowhat we have are different types of sensor networks like this which are connected twodifferent things like computer grid two different instruments such as microscope telescope andso on scientific instruments different collaborators through mobile phones etcetera etcetera researchersdifferent historical data legacy data which a store in data servers are you know serverforms cloud etcetera etcetera and taking care of issues such as weather forecasts pollutiondetection software model workflow and so onso all these together form what is known as the sensor web so in sensor web we have todeal with different types of servers which will take care of web notification servicessensor collection services planning services modeling language and so on where is the modelinglanguage we have the sensor modeling language like right here and so on so all these wnssensor ah ah collection service running service sensor ml and so many different types of conceptsand [com/components] components that have to be usedso in sensor web we have concepts of observations and measurements sensor ml which is sort oflike an xml extended xml ah ah a very similar in lines with ah let us say uml you know somekind of a modeling language that supports sensor modeling then we have the transducermodeling language transducer ml sensor observation service sensor planning service sensor alertservice web notifications services all these put together basically a constitutes the sensorweb now few other concepts have to be taken care of one is the concept of cooperationcooperation is paramount we are talking about you know a multi hop network where there arerelay nodes in between so what happens if these intermediate relay nodes instead offorwarding the packet further they drop the packet because they will tend to be selfishthey will tend to be selfish because to forward the packet to relay the packet forward theywould have to expend their own little energy so why would they do thatso these nodes are supposed to be cooperative but but they may not be as much cooperativebecause of all these selfish interests you know resource limitations and all these differentother types of considerations the intermediate nodes act as relays the wireless nodes areenergy constraints the notes may or may not cooperate consequently because of all thesedifferent constraints the nodes may not be willing to cooperate with the other nodesfor collectively accomplishing the tasks that are supposed to be required to be accomplishedin such a social network socially connected networkso taking care of the issue of cooperation there are two extremities that have to bethought about one is the total case of total is total cooperation and the other one isthe case of total non cooperation case of total cooperation where all the relay requeststhat are received are accepted by the nodes and the nodes will quickly exhaust the limitedenergy and the case of total non cooperation if no relay requests are accepted the networkthroughput will go down rapidly so these are the two different extremities and they arecorresponding limitations are mentioned over here so if none of the relay requests areby are accepted then what is going to happen the network throughput will go down rapidlyso there are issues of selfishness self interests symbiotic dependence between these differentagents there have to be worked out that have to be increased in order to symbiotic dependencehas to be increased not selfishness of course selfishness is a problem self [in/interest]interest selfishness are problems that have to be handled and symbiotic dependence howit can be promoted and that also has to be thought of and corresponding mathematicalmodels have to be developed and the trade off is between the nodes lifetime versus thethroughput there are security i challenges in cooperation so first of all we have toget back to our old concept that means multi hop network in a multi hop network sensornode the intermediate node is cooperating with other nodesnow that cooperating node is a good guy so that good guy by looking at it there are somany you know there could there could malicious nodes which might want to intentionally hurtthe successful successful ah functioning of it and the other similar kinds of nodes sowhat it can do is it can initiate a denial of service attack kind of thing so what itwill do is it will start ah you know ah ah pumping in lot of false routing informationthat and thereby paralyzing the whole network so this is basically one of the security challengesin cooperation so with this we come to an end of the first lecture on sensor networksfor developing internet of things and in subsequent lectures we are going to go through the differentother concepts in sensor networks we have already seen that there are so many differenttypes of constraints and challenges that have to be overcome in a sensor network and thatis where the sensor networks have to work on to ah you know ah to come up with differentsolutions that have to be [im/implemented] implemented in them to make them work efficiently thank you
