so we continue with ah few other protocols ah and ah now we are going to look at onevery interesting protocol which is bit different from the previous protocol that we have beendiscussings ah discussing in the context of basics of networking iot networking so thisprotocol is the amqp protocol the full form of which is advanced message queuing protocoland this advanced message queuing protocol basically follows some kind of an open standardwhich is based on the iso so it follows basically the iso iec nineteen four sixty four standardso this standard basically helps define how mistis are going to be passed from businessesbusiness applications or organizations so so in other words a particular business iscomprised of different systems and different processes business processes so a businesscan be conceived of as a collection of different systems and business processes so this particularstandard helps in communicating between these systems connecting rather connecting betweenthese different systems and the business processes of that particular businessso it is a binary application layer protocol it is an application layer protocol and thethe the the unit ah that is used for data transfer in this case is known as the frameso it is bit different from the concept of frame in the link layer so you know here alsoit is known as frame but it is not the exactly the same frame that we talked about in thecontext of link layer protocols so let us now try to understand how this particularprotocol works so we have clients which are producers of different messages we have aserver and on the other hand we again have a layer of clients which are a consumer ofthe messages so we have the producers of the messages we have the server which comprisesof routers and ah filters and queues for forwarding the message for for queuing and for bufferingand forwarding the messages and then we have the consumers of the message so this serverbasically acts as a broker the server acts as a brokerso essentially what happens is these clients for example different sensors they producedifferent data they produce different messages so these messages are sent to the differentrouters and filters in this manner which again can be buffered in a queue and with the intentionof forwarding them ah again in the future and these data the forwarded data beyond theserver are sent to other types of clients which are the consumers of these messagesso we have the producers we have the server in between and we have the consumersso amqp can be thought of as a collection of different features these features basicallycuts across things such as organization so basically amqp can help in connecting differentorganizations connecting different technologies connecting different organizations with respectto time that means at different points of time and the technologies and the organizationsthat are located in different locations connecting them as wellso these are the main features of amqp so connecting organizations technologies timeand space which could be distinct from one and so distinct organizations distinct technologiesdist ah you know with respect to time variations in time variations in the space amqp basicallyhelps in connection few other features from a different perspectiveamqp supports security reliability interoperability i think security and reliability are understoodi do not mean to elaborate on them further but in terms of interoperability we are basicallyreferring to interoperability of not only devices but also protocols algorithms messagesand so on so this is the next feature and then routing of messages queuing of messagesand that it follows an open standard which is based on isoso there are different messages that are involved in this particular protocol and what is requiredis to have message delivery guarantees these message delivery guarantees can be in threedifferent forms the first one is at most once which means that each message is deliveredat most once that means once or never to the intended recipient at least once each messageis certain to be delivered but may do so multiple times but it it should do at least words exactlyonce messages will always certainly arrive and do so only once so these are the threedifferent message types a message ah ah ah delivery ah ah ah types ah and guaranteesthat are involved in this process so the different frame types there are nineamqp frame types that are ah used for defining ah ah to initiate control and tear down thetransfer of message messages between two peers so we have the first one the first frame typeis the open frame type which is used for opening a connection corresponding to this we havethe closed frame type closed frame which is for closing the connection which is for closingthe connection then we have the begin frame type which is for opening a session and correspondinglywe have the end which is for closing that particular session then we have the attachwhich is basically used for initiating a new link transfer for sending actual messagesflow for controlling message flow rate and disposition that informs the changes in stateof transfer and then we have the detach which is for terminating the link so open closebegin end attach detach and in between we have transfer flow and disposition frame frametypes so the different components of this particularprotocol include three things three primary things one is exchange the second is queueand a third is bindings so the exchange component is basically part of the broker that is inthat is task to receive messages and route them to the queues queues are basically separateah for different business processes so different separate queues are used for different ahor separate business processes and the consumers receive the messages from the queues bindingsare rules for distributing the messages which means that who can determining who can accesswhat message the destinations of the message and so onso we have ah you know different exchange types in the case of amqp ah amqp has ah basicallyfour different exchange types one is the direct the second is basically the fan out the thirdis the topic and fourth is the header so these are the four different ah am amqp ah ah ahexchanges so direct exchange fan out exchange topic exchange and header exchange so we arenot going to go through these in detail ah just to keep things simpler and ah easilyah easily remembering so that is the reason we have not discussed these in further detailso these are some of the features of amqp it offers targeted qos which basically targetsselective offering of qos to certain links persistence which basically implies mes ahoffering message delivery gua guarantees then we have the delivery of messages to multipleconsumers the possibility of ensuring multiple consumption possibility of preventing ah multipleconsumption and high speed in terms of the applications ah it can beused for monitoring and global updates sharing applications connecting different systemsand processes to talk to one another allowing the servers to respond to immediate requestsquickly and delegate time consuming tasks for little processing distributing a messageto multiple clients for consumption enabling offline clients to fetch data at any timeand increasing the reliability and uptime of application deploymentsso this basically concludes the discussion about ah ah this protocol so ah with thiswe basically come to an end of the series of lectures on the basics of iot networkingand ah in the next lecture again we will look at few ah protocols but the perspective fromwhich we are going to look at is going to be different so there we are to look at protocolsthat are very much useful and that are used for establishing connectivity in iotthank you
