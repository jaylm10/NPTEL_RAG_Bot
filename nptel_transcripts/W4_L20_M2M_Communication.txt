machine to machine communication we are going to cover in this particular lecture machineto machine communication is one of the very vital very important concepts in buildinginternet of things when we are talking about internet of things autonomous behaviour issomething that we strive to imbibe or test ah we try to ah inculcate in this networksthat we ah develop and for this basically what we have to do is we have to ensure thatwith minimal intervention how we can achieve different tasks and ah so we are talking aboutsensors we are talking about ah actuators we are talking about mobile phones we aretalking about robotic devices ground robotic devices rovers etcetera etcetera uavs andso onso different types of machines and the whole idea of machine to machine communication isthat with minimal or strictly speaking no human intervention how we can have communicationbetween two machines two machines so machine to machine communication right so this iswhat we ah try to achieve in ah machine to machine communication and machine to machinecommunication is considered to be one of the most important building blocks for internetof things so iot based systems have to operate autonomously if it is let us say if we areconsidering something like a home automation let us consider this particular scenariolet us say that we have you know elderly care in a smart home and the elderly people theyhave mobility impairments typically not necessarily but it is quite common that there are mobilityproblems with elderly people and in a smart home environment what might so happen thatthere might be some robotic devices which can be helping ah these ah residents of ahome to undertake different things so we can have a ground robot for example for exampleit can go and open the door of a refrigerator this robot can go and it can open the doorof a refrigerator then this particular robot it can even take a milk pot out of the refrigeratorthen pour the milk into into a glass that milk can be put into a microwave oven andas you can see that there is no human intervention at all everything can be done with the helpof machines interacting with machines i will give you one more example in this particularcontext let us say that the in the robot has openedthe refrigerator and it finds that there is no sufficient milk then either the robot orthe refrigerator can automatically send an sms to the milk person so what happens machineto machine again there is no human intervention no human has sent that sms to the to the milkperson so this becomes an example of machine to machine communication so that is why iwas telling you that machine to machine communication has become very much attractive for iot basedapplications involving applications such as smart homes smart cities and so on let usgo ahead and look at some of these concepts so we have communication between machinesor devices with communication and computing facilities and ideally or strictly there isno human intervention there is no human intervention at all now i do not know whether you are alreadyaware of or not traditionally there used to be the scada systems this scada systems aresupervisory control systems that used to be typically used in industrial plants and soon so ah for you know supervisory and control operations functioning and so on but typicallythese used to be not wireless but wire so m two m can be thought of as the wirelessvariant of scada wireless variant of scada this is just you know conceptually i am ahi am just ah ah you know making a comparison with scada but it is not like ah you knowits wireless scada is m two m it is not like that but you know conceptually we can thinkof m two m as a wireless variant of scada so scada is designed for isolated systemsusing proprietary solutions whereas m two m is designed for cross plat platform integrationthis is very important typically scada is used for a single proprietary solutions andon the other hand m two m tries to connect ah you know cross platform integrate crossplatform between ah ah different ah ah ah different technologies supporting differentplatforms so even like you know ah windows linux android you know all of them differentdevices supporting different platforms that kind of interconnect can also happen withm two m so let us consider this particular examplewhere it is some some sort of a scenario of ah offering emergency services on the highwayso let us say that two cars in this particular example scenario we see that two cars thesecars fitted with different types of sensors emergency sensors collide these cars collideso after the crash an alert is generated an alert is generated and the data is sent tothe remote servers from these servers through these base station that data would be sentto the hospital and emergency services to the patients ah ah you know ah to to the doctorsorry to to the to the doctors it can be sent to the ambulance it can be sent and so onand accordingly ambulances might be dispatched doctors might be put on alert paramedics mightbe alerted and so on and as you can see over here like this actually the scenario continuesas you can see over here know where the human came into pictureso everything human came into picture means that humans can be the receivers like doctorsreceiving the information is something but humans were not operators or not they didnot function any operation on the network right so this is completely m two m scenariothat has been shown in this particular figure so in m two m when we are talking about mtwo m we are talking about sensors sensors producing data through the network informationis extracted out of the data that is received it is processed and if required some actuationis done maybe opening off the valve in an agricultural field if the soil moisture levelhas gone downthere are different m two m applications environment monitoring civil protection and public safetysupply chain management energy and utility distribution as in smart grid smart grid separatelycommon in smart grid what we are doing we are using ict involving sensors actuatorsetcetera in a traditional smart grid so in a smart ah sorry in a traditional power gridso in a traditional power grid we already had flow of electricity in a smart grid wehave sensors etcetera etcetera which are throwing in lot of data which have to be communicatedso we have communication and networks on top of the traditional power power systems powerflow or energy flowthen we have intelligent transportation systems healthcare automation of buildings militaryapplications agriculture home networks all these are different different applicationsof ah m two m let us now look at some of the features of m two m let us say the numberof nodes that are required in m two m we are talking typically of large number of nodesor iot devices which are able you know which where there is no human to intervene theytalk to each other directly these are low cost or energy efficient these nodes are energyefficient the network as a whole is energy efficient and typically low cost because thesenodes are also very small in size very cheap cheap to buy commercially and so onso ah and there is small traffic that is generated per machine or device then large quantityof data are collected and the m two m m two m communication is free from human interventionit is free strictly but you know in practical applications actually sometimes there mightbe some minimal human intervention but strictly in m two m basically you know there has theredoes there should not be any human intervention at all then ah human intervention is requiredfor operational stability and sustainability only there are different types of m two mnodes we have the low end nodes we have the mid end nodes and the high end noteslet us look at the features of each of these one by one in the low end sensor nodes wehave we are talking about nodes which are low in cost with a cheap and also quite justifiablythey have low capabilities their specifications are very [li/limited] very limited then ahthey are typically static energy efficient and simple these low end nodes deploymentof these nodes has high density in order to increase the network lifetime and survivabilitybecause these are small with small space etcetera etcetera you need large number of them tobe deployed in a ah you know in a highly dense manner these nodes are heavily resource constrainedthere is no ip support basic functionalities such as data aggregation auto configurationand power saving are supported and these are generally used for environmental monitoringapplicationsmid end sensor nodes relatively more expensive than the low end sensor nodes have some degreesof mobility have fewer constraints with respect to resource complexities or ah you know computationalcomplexities energy efficiency and so on and ah they support different functionalitiesfor example they are not like low end nodes with bare basic you know functionality notlike that they have some little bit more functionality with respect to like localization qualityof service support tcp ip support or control traffic control intelligence and so on typicalah application includes home networks supply chain management asset management and industrialautomation high end sensor nodes low density of deployment they are able to handle multimediadata or video with quality of service sometimes even quality of service guaranties also theycan offer then ah mobility is essential for these nodes ah you know so ah like you knowthese are like full fledged nodes with lot of different capabilities including mobilityas wellso smartphones are good examples of these type of nodes then ah we have ah these nodestypically used for military or biomedical applications when we consider the m two mecosystem as a whole we have different components of it we have device providers we have internetservice providers platform providers service providers and service users so let us lookup look at each of these ah ah in in detail in this particular figure so you know so inthis particular figure what we see is we have this m two m net area network m two m areanetwork and we have the device provider the device provider is the one which basicallyprovides these devices which basically is the owner of these devicesso this is basically the m two m area network then this m two m area network sends the datafrom this m two m devices iot devices through this gateway to the internet which is basicallyhandled by the internet service provider and when it is passing through it we have thisrestful architecture that basically takes care of it the restful architecture is a lowend you know low resource consuming resource limited environment it is useful and in thiscase we are using it between as an interface between the device provider and the internetservice provider then from the internet service provider it comes to the platform providerwhich takes care of functionalities such as device management user management data analyticsand user access and then again through a restful architecture interface you know ah it is sentto the service providers and the users and the corresponding business model is takencare of at this particular stageso when we talk about this service platform we have the m two m service platform in shortit is called the m two sp and in this m two m service platform we are talking about differentfunctionalities of devices different functionalities of users different applications and accessall these different functionalities right so functionalities with respect to deviceinclude the device profile management device and m two m network management and devicesearching user profile management authentication and charging are taken care of by the userdata collection data control service management connection management by application and appmanagement app searching web portal in the access controlso all these data are passed through an access network like wi fi zigbee etcetera and aresent to the m two m area network ok this is one possibility the other possibility is thatfrom this m two m area network and several such [are/area] area networks these data aresent through the access network to the core network which supports these platforms withrespect to device user application and access so both way actually from here we can youknow we can either think of it from here when towards the m two m area network or from them two m area network towards the core network we can think of both way communication takingplace both wayso the only the flow of the data is different so what type of data is flowing that is differentso when we talk about the device platform it enables access to objects or devices connectedto the internet anywhere and at any time the register devices create a database of objectsfrom which the managers users and services can easily access the information the deviceplatform manages the device profiles such as location device type address and descriptionit provides authentication and authorization key management functionalities and monitorsthe status of devices and m two m area networks and controls control them ah based on theirstatusnow the user platform manages the m two m service user profiles and provides functionalitiessuch as user registration modification charging inquiry incorporate ah in interoperates withthe device platform and manages the user access restrictions to devices object networks orservices and service providers and device managers have administrative privileges ontheir devices or networks application platform provides integrated services based on thedevice collected data and the heterogeneous data merging is done in this particular platformfrom various devices the data that is obtained are used for creating new services accessplatform basically provides app or web access environment to users the apps and the linksredirect to the service providers the services are actually provided through this platformto the m two m devices and this access platform provides the app management for smart deviceapps so this is a scenario of non ip based m twom network so here what we see is as you can see over here we have a non ip based m twom network m two m area network and here we see an ip based network and this applicationlayer basically seamlessly integrates these two application layer basically seamlesslyintegrates the ip network and the m two m network in this manner then we have the ipbased m two m network where everything was as usual so we have the same set of layersapplication layer transport layer network layer sensor or mac layer and this is thesame all across m two m area network management features are like this that fault toleranceis a very important if there is some fault system is going to take care of it automaticallyscalability is another important issue or feature of ah network management of m twom ah area networks and ah so basically new when we increase the number of nodes m twom nodes or iot nodes you know that basically doesnt affect the efficiency ah ah quite ahsignificantlyso efficiency is ah taken care of you know it it still remains efficient low cost andlow complexity are other features if we energy efficiency configuration capabilities dynamicconfiguration capabilities then minimized network management traffic and these are theones which are important features of m two m area network management so with this wecome to an end of understanding more about the basic features of ah m two m ah communicationm two m as i said at the outset is one of the important enabling technologies for internetof things and building of iot based systems and ah so in m two m we are talking abouttwo or more machines you know communicating with one another with minimal or no humanintervention at all so this as i said is a very important technology for building ofinternet of things thank you
