in this lecture we are going to introduce to you the language the python programminglanguage so this python programming language ah lecture is divided into two parts so inboth the parts again i will be assisted by your ta mister anandarup mukherjee so he isgoing to take you through the basics of the python programming language so before we starti just wanted to highlight upon that [python/python] python is a very popular programming languageat present it is among other applications it is very much useful for embedded systemsapplication development for example iot based application development python is very popularthere are several reasons for it one of the reasons is it is a lightweight programminglanguage in the sense that from a programmer pointof view first of all it is not very difficult to learn this language it is more like a scriptinglanguage it is of course object oriented but it is a scripting language and scripting likelanguage and you know it is very easy to learn this programming language in the same wayas mat lab for instance is also very easy to learn python is also very easy to learnand also ah you know python is supported by ah different embedded systems developmentplatforms or iot development platforms such as ah raspberry pi which you are going tolearn ah in this course but you know so it it supports different types of iot devicesand and also you know you do not need to take help of complex libraries etcetera etceteraexecution is faster and so there were so many different advantagesbecause of which python based programming is very important ah to learn particularlyif you are interested in ah iot based application development and that is why ah you know inthis course we are going to ah teach you ah a little bit of python programming to getyou started and as before you know if you have your environment ready you can alongwith the lecture you can also code yourself so that the learning becomes better so thatway it will become a a enhance on experience for you so for all the lectures in moduletwo of this course you can do the same thing you can ah keep your respective environmentready so that you can do the ah do the you know ah the programming exercises while weteach you ah programming and enhance on exercises while while we teach you the conceptsin this lecture i will be covering the basics of python programming so we will just talkabout how to startup with the basic programming or scripting in python and the basic syntaxand all those initial integritys so first of all why python now from my personalpoint of view python ah i have worked on mat lab i have worked on c c plus plus but i findpython to be a very versatile language the scripting is very easy it is very easy towrite the code it is very easy to read the code and moreover it does not support strictrules for syntax so its installation comes with an integrated ide so the programmingis actually very easy will come to that in the consecutive slides so and for iot youmust have seen in various online resources and lectures and courses people prefer pythonbecause it supports an interface with a wide range of hardware platforms and moreover sinceit is a open source platform so you have lots of libraries lots of collaborative work lotsof examples available online on github on various repositories so it forms a strongbackbone to build large applications now the python ide is like arduino is a free and opensource software so you can write various codes integrated ah integrate various modules librariesand so on it can be easily integrated with windows linux and mac machines so some examplesof python ide is are spyder pycharm and so onso my personal preference i as a personal preference i use spyder to code my programi will show you a visual of spyder so this is basically spyder it is an editor for pythonas well as there is an output console over here and for the python distribution i amusing python two point seven as you can see over here python two point seven and i amusing a python ah distribution using anacondas anaconda is a collection of various librariesin resources so i find it quite useful since lots and lots of library is very useful andcommonly available as well as some uncommon libraries are also integrated with anacondaso that is also my personal preference so you can obviously have normal idle ways systemsso you have a ide called id le idle and so on so this left hand side is the editor partthis right hand side is the console part you can even write on the console so problem isyou write one line and whenever you press enter it executes start line so that sometimesbecomes bit problematic whereas in the editor you write the whole code or the script andthen collectively execute it so for larger programs and systems this becomesmuch easiernow to start off with python simple example is you write you want to print something somestatement so you just write print hi welcome to python or any other statement the outputwill be hi welcome to python so as you can see the syntax is pretty straight forwardyou dont need to call any libraries you dont need any main function you dont need otherfunctions nothing you just and remember whenever you encounter maybe online you encounter pythoncodes or anything and you encounter these arrows basically means your code is beingrun on the console and otherwise it is for the editor you can interchange between thetwo no issues ok so now to indicate different blocks of thecode python however follows a very rigid indentation policy right so suppose normal fl statementso if true then colon you have an indentation print correct else then again you go backelse colon again indent print error so this indentation policy has to be followed whenevermainly whenever you enter into a loop so after one statement or this colon you have to giveone tab space indentation so there are five data types in python numbersyou have x y z equal to you assigned ten ten point two then you write python so x willbe assigned as ten y will be assigned as ten point two and z will be assigned as pythonso remember this x has been assigned with an integer value y has been assigned witha float floating type value and z has been assigned with a string right again for thesake of toying around with how you manipulate strings so suppose you assign x equal to withinquotes this is python ok one more point single quotes and double quotes those actually dontmatter too much you can use them interchangeably so over here you see the string python iswithin double quotes over here it is within single quotes you can use either so stringx equal to this is python so this string you are assigning to x now you print xso your output will be this is python now you want to access now this x is an arrayright so you want to access access the zeroth element of x so you write x within bracketzero so this will give you the very first element that is the zeroth index element thatis t now suppose you want to access certain selected elements so you write x two colonfour that means select from index two up two index four and index four will be excludedso you have actually two and three right so zero one two three so is right so is has beenselected and this is the output of this third statement better still will take a lookso we will start off with a fresh consolestarting a new cornel so you can also write over here you write let us say printso i can execute this thing from the editor see print this is a test message this wasthe line of the script and this in white is the output so this is a text message otherwisei can also write on the console itself maybe i right lets use single quotes i write hithere so you just get the output over here directly so as you can recall in c or c plusplus specially in c you had to call all those library functions using hash include stdiodot h hash include konya dot h and so on and prior to printing you had to go to the mainloop definition and all those things so nothing is required for python you juststart writing a script immediately ok so this was the first demo now lets see ah lets assignx equal to lets assign string two x maybe this is a test right so this is a test thisstring has been assigned to x lets check i just print x so perfect this is a test nowi want to assign ah i want to select a specific element from the string lets say zeroso x zero it prints t which is the first character right now suppose i want to sell i want toprint a specific range lets say two two seven right so is space is right maybe we can changeit to six two nine right s space a right so its fairly simple to understandnow various other data types are you have a data type called list so list is an ordersequence of items right you can see x equal to within the square brackets you have tencomma ten point two comma within quotes python so you can assign a integers a float as wellas well as a string type to this various elements of the list then next data type is calledthe tuple so tuple is an ordered sequence of items whichonce created cannot be changed or modified next is a dictionary so dictionary is an unorderedcollection of key value pairs used to contain a huge amount of data for example ah thiskey is one colon the value is item then again ka the value is two and so on now again similarto your arduino programming or other languages you have basic control statements so startupwith if elif statement so you have if then a condition then statement one may be statementtwo you you can have multiple statements but remember if then the condition and then colonand since it follows a tabbing policy strict tabbing policy indentation policy so you needto have indentation while you enter a loop so statement one statement two have to beindented then whenever you are using elsif the syntax is elif e l i f again a conditionthen again colon then a post indentation you have two statements and finally else whichalso has two statements post indentation so this is fairly simple to understand anotherloop you consider is the while loop you have while condition colon after indentation youhave statement one statement two thats it now for an simple example suppose x equalto one two three and four this is a list x is a list now for i in x that is you iterateover the indexes one zero one two three so for i in x you gave a statement you gave anotherstatement so you can modify it in various ways we will check it out later then you havevarious other controlling statements like break so for s in string string may be anythingso let us say this is the string then colon then indentation if s equal to equal to nit compares if s is equal to n then it breaks it prints s and then prints end right andthen continue for sn string if s equal to equal to y it continues then prints s andthen end now defining various functions in python youcan for ease of your implementation for ease of your understanding whenever you are writinga very complicated function of very large program it is always advisable to modularizeyour code as in suppose your code includes checking for a prime number checking for afactorial or returning the factorial value of a function and so on like you have twentyto thirty different such functions so and you need to include this functionsmultiple times within the complete code so it is always advisable you define that functiononce only and just call that function again and again so this would not only save youlots of confusion but also will make your code easy to understand so this definitionof a function it can be either without a return value so you write as def a function nameof your choice then various arguments of your choice you can have n number of argumentsdepending on the function and then a colon then again an indentation statement one statementtwo thats it right maybe statement two is a print statement so you give arguments onetwo and three statement one does some operations on these three arguments and statement twoprints the result of the arguments another type is with a return value so as you cansee these things are the same in the end there is a return function so maybe statement twois x equal to some operation and eventually it returns the value of xso the function which calls this ah the point where this function has been called in themain code it will have x return to it right for example whenever you are calling a functionsuppose def example str then print str plus this not character so your example ah outsidethis function you just call this function example hi and your output is hi it wouldbe better ifwe do get to a little hands on lets say i define a function as capital iot i give argumentsas xy and z colon io statement as may be a equal to x plus y minus z right andit returns the value of x right so my function has been defined now outside this functionmaybe later on i just call this function iot it will require three arguments maybe i willright five four three right and since i will be expecting a return value i assign thisfunction a variable sorry i assign this function to a variable so let the variable b b b equalto iot five four and three right lets see what happens so first we needto save this code ok now execute this code all at onceok so this code has been executed but i forgotto give a print statement lets print b now will execute this again as you can see yourarguments were five four and three so the first two will be added and the third willbe subtracted from the result so your result will be six right so this is a result so thisis pretty simple i guess now since defining a function has been coveredso similarly you can define various of the function suppose ah you take to argumentsand define which one is greater or which one is lesser so you check whether x is greaterthan y it will return x and y else it will return y and x so outside this function definitionyou assign you assign this function to a variable as greater two values as ten and hundred printval so hundred is obviously greater than ten so if this happens it will return this oney and x so your output is hundred comma ten so its pretty straight forward now functionsas objects so whenever you are ah these using these functions these can be assigned andreassigned to various variables for example you write a function for addition you candirectly do the operation at the return statement itself now you print add for six and againyou assign add for six to c and then print cso for both the output will be ten right so there are two types of variable scopes oneis the global variable that is accessible those variables are accessible all acrossthe your code ah and these variables can be accessed outside as well as inside a functionand local variables these are the once which are only declared inside a function and cannotbe accessed from outside so for example before a function ah suppose the definition of afunction def example these are some operations you define a variable as g var equal to tenso this and another variable as i var equal hundred so within example you can call g varbut outside example you cannot call i var so basic variation again you have a variableas ten with an example variable equal to hundred you print this var and you call this exampleand again print var so what will happen is within this example it prints var so thisvar will be hundred which is locally assigned right so initially it was the global variableis ten but this ah overrides that value and reassign hundred to it but outside this functionthis is not valid so for the second print statement it willprint the global variable ten so you have various modules in python so you import themodule name now you can also call for the extension for example you import random nowthe random has many such functions as random integer one to ten and so on so for examplethe script for i in range one to ten as when you have a list of nine numbers one two threefour up to nine value is random dot randint one to ten it will randomly generate numbersbetween one and ten and print value so since this is random number generator it will theoutput will vary upon each execution so it is better you try this yourself so you canalso try a particular function from within a module like from math import pi and thenprint pi it will just print the value of pi now there are various exceptional handlersin python these are mainly used for debugging or in case of errors in various complicatedscripts they will give you the exceptions like try then statement except exception statementselse statements one example is while true tryso within this type the function will execute this statements these statements will executeif it there is some error so it catches that error and accept the value error not a validinteger so whatever in number you are inputting it gets stored in n it is converted into integerand you break it and after that this print statement executes if you somehow erroneouslyinput ah string number to it string or the character to it so it wont be converted tointeger so it will print not a valid integer so it is better you try this code also anotherexample code is to check whether a number is prime or not and so on so these kind ofcomplication complications can be increased and you can have multiple nested loops ahyou can have multiple functions function within the function although its not advisable butstill so this was it thank you
