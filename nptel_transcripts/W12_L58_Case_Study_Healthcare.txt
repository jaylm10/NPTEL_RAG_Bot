now we are going to cover some case studies particularly focusing on healthcare so theuse of iot for healthcare so we have seen in the previous lectures in the differentmodules that we have covered so far in this course that different types of sensors arepossible and these sensors can help in sensing whatever they are supposed to sense so inthe context of healthcare there are different sensors that have been fabricated that hasthat have been developed to monitor the physiological condition of human beings so for example therecan be body temperature sensor which can measure exactly what a normal temperature normal thermometerdoes there can be blood pressure sensor which can measure the blood pressure of human beingthere can be likewise different other types of sensors for example pulse oximeter sensorecg sensor emg sensor and many other different types of sensorsso in the iot sphere these different sensors which have been developed individually bydifferent companies different research labs and so on they can be used to build the sensornodes and we have in a previous lecture we have already gone through what are the differentcomponents of a sensor node so sensor is one of the one of those components likewise thereare different other components there is a processing unit that is required there isa communication unit there is a power unit and so onso all these different units put together ah is basically a sensor node and the sensornode can sends the physiological parameter based on the sensor that is ah fixed withthat particular node and likewise in the human body there could be different sensors whichcan be basically you know sense sensing the different ah physical physiological phenomenaand sending to the sensor node either singly or different sensor nodes together they canbe sending different data to ah to one particular ah one particular such node and from thatnode the data can be sent elsewhere for further processing and so onso what we have we have number one the sensing number two is the communication of the sensedata to somewhere and then from that place the data either has to be you know it hasto be processed locally or it has to be sent somewhere else for better processing for fasterprocessing and dissemination of the results of the processing so this is exactly whatis typically done in most of the iot healthcare solutions so in this particular lecture iam going to cover what are the different iot healthcare sensors that are there and howthese can be used to build different systems that can help in continuous real time withremote monitoring of patients which is taken up as a specific case study and this is thesystem which is known as the ambusens system that we have developed in our lab ah in thelab of iit kharagpur and so in the little part we are going to talk about what thisparticular ah system does and some of the important salient features of this particularsystem ambusens system so you know when we talk about the sensorsthe sensors in the context of health care the sensors they can collect the patient dataover time and i have already mentioned what kind of data so these data could measure bloodpressure or body temperature or you know oxygen saturation in the blood and so on and so forthso this data is collected and this data can be analyzed further either locally or remotelyfor you know for different purposes for example to enable preventive care so you know preventivecare means like you know you collect a data over time and based on that you try to understandthat whether there is a critical element that is going to come in the future for that particularpatient so this is number one number two is that if a particular patientis in the hospital for instance then that patient ah you know is typically you knowit is ah the the patient is under different types of medications and the patient is fittedwith different types of devices and so on so understanding the effects of the therapytherapy that is being ah you know subjected to that particular patient so ah the effectsof the cell therapy on the patient so this is another advantage of using the sensorsah and connectivity basically what it does is the connectivity will allow these sensedata to be sent remotely for remote processing decision making and so onnow ah that the devices they have different types of ability to collect data they canyou know they can either automatically obtain the data and the data can be sent to doctorsyou know then and there itself or it can be the data can be stored ah in some server orsomething like that where then will be some kind of analytics that will be run that willbe executed and based on the analytics if somebody in if a patient is ah likely to getsome serious condition then the corresponding doctor is going to be notified so as you canunderstand that by automating these things with the help of sensors and connectivitywhat we are trying to do is number one we are trying to reduce the manual interventionthat means the attention of the doctors ah continuouslysecond thing is the chances of error the risks of errors occurring also get reduced becauseautomation inherently basically reduces the chances of error and that overall you knowthese things would overall increase the efficiency while reducing the cost of operation costof ah you know maintenance and operation of a of healthcare system so there are differentcomponents of iot healthcare so i already mentioned that you know there has to be sensorsthe physiological sensors so these sensors are part of the sensing layer and the sensorsah ah you know they could consists of all these different types of sensors that i mentionedthe rfids ah you know sensor networks and so on and google class and fitbit trackerthese are some of these different devices that execute in the sensing layerthen you have the aggregated layer ah which basically you know aggregates the data thatare received from the sensors of the sensing layer and this data aggregators could be thingslike you know smart phones or tablets and so on so what these data aggregated does isfrom the different parts of the human body the different sensed data that are obtainedthese are basically connected and these are you know these are put together and you knowah and instead of sending the individual data together you know reduced number of ah ahdata are sent forward from that particular aggregator node so then you have the sensinglayer the aggregator layer and then we have the processing layer where basically the processinglayer and the cloud platform these are responsible for the storing of the data and the processingof the data that have been that have been collected and analyzing further that you knowwhat action should be taken based on the received dataso we have ah these different types of sensors as part of the sensing and measurement soyou have these different sensors the smart watch and blood pressure sensor and so onwhich would sense and measure the physiological conditions data are sent to these differentaggregator nodes ah you know which could be ah ah which could be like these differentpds or you know mobile phones smartphones and so on and from the data aggregator thedata are sent further from the aggregator by the way this segregator is also known asthe lpu sometimes the that means the local processing unit so typically if you are talkingabout a human body the body area network so typically in a body area network you havea single lpu which receives the sensor data from the different parts of the bodyso every human being has that lpu which is a smartphone or a tab or something of thatsort and that particular device connects receives all these data and this data is further processedin the cloud and in the different servers and based on that ah you know different decisionmaking can be made ah and based on the decisions ah the corresponding stakeholders could beinformed about what is happening with the patient if it is required so there are differentdirections of research in iot healthcare ah number one is remote health care and thisis where we have done a little bit of work in our lab and so what happened says you havethe all these different sensors the blood pressure monitor sensor the temperature sensorand so on which typically are developed ah by different vendors different companies andso what happens is you know at the same time remotely ah with the help of the sensors thedoctors and the paramedics you know they can the healthcare professionals in general theycan monitor the condition of different patients in a large scale ah you know in numbers theycan monitor the different patients ah even remotely so thats the remote health careso this wireless iot different solutions being health care to patients rather than bringthe patients to the health care so so typically you know earlier what is used to happen orthe in the traditional healthcare the patient should have to go through the healthcare facilitieslike hospitals or the nursing homes and so on and in the iot based health care what happensis all these different medical devices they are portable they are wearable and so on sothey can be the human beings the patients they they can wear and only thing that hasto be done is that somehow this data from this wearable sensors have to be sent to thecorresponding medical professionals for example your personal doctor ah you know the familydoctor and so on who you know if it is required ah you know the doctor would intervene furthermaybe because of some serious condition going on in the patient and so onso ah securely in this sort of systems would capture a variety of medical data throughiot based sensors analyze the data ah with different smart algorithms and this wirelesslythis data that is obtained from this different sensors are sent wirelessly ah to differentmedical professionals for for for the recommendation real time monitoring is possible as a resultof the use of the different sensors this biomedical this ah you know physiological sensors ahreal time monitoring is possible so earlier what is to happening is that if you need tomonitor you know if you need to know how much is your blood pressure you would have to goto the hospital and get your blood pressure measured or even if you have a blood pressuremeasurement ah ah device at home you know typically what happens is you do not measureit all the time right so in in the case of this kind of system wherethere are different sensors the blood pressure sensor you know the blood pressure sensorwould be you know with the help of the sensors it will be possible to monitor ah the conditionof the patients in real time round the clock it is possible but then you know it dependson the implementation policies and so on that how often this measurement is going to bedone based on the requirements of the stakeholders the sensors are used to collect comprehensingphysiological data then that this data are sent to the to the cloud through the gatewaysfor further analysis and storage rather storage analysisso wirelessly this systems would send the data to the caregivers and thereby overallthe system as a whole would reduce or would lower the cost of healthcare so this is theschematic of ah you know how such a system would work you have these different sensorsthese different heterogeneous sensors you know denoted by different colours and so thesesensors would sends ah and send the data ah and that those data would be made availableah to the remote doctors and the doctors can monitor in real time how much how how withthe the heart rate ah ah is varying for a particular patient or how the body temperatureis varying and so on and the next advantage is of preventive care ah ah so in preventivecare what you need to do is you know you have some of this target group of patients treatedwith different physiological sensors and for instance in the case of ah seniors seniorcitizens ah who do not have any caregiver at home they could be fitted with differentsensors and one of the common problems with this senior people is that ah you know theyoften ah fall down right so fall detection is an important problemand this fall detection is part of this preventive health care and ah so what happens is if thereis an emergency situation that occurs and the detection of this emergency situationand alerting the family members under those situations for example the senior citizenhas fallen down at home so if there is a proper system iot healthcare system in place thenthe corresponding people in the persons family or the different relatives they could be ahah they could be informed about this particular event that means the falling of the ah theperson then ah there are different interesting toolsfrom machine learning that that could be used to to track the trend and to predict whatis going to happen in the future for example if there is any anomaly detection of the anomalyand how this anomaly is varying with time and what can be done in the future to preventso all these things are possible with the layer with the help of different machine learningtools so now we come ah ah to the ambusens system and ah as i already told you initiallythis ambusens system has been developed by us ah ah and it was actually funded by a jointah ah project supported by iit kharagpur and majority through funds from majority governmentof india and so this in this project we have developeda system which can help in remote monitoring remote continuous monitoring of patients inambulances when they are transferred from remote health care centers to city hospitalsthe you know which is a very typical kind of scenario that happens in ah in the caseare in a for health care in our country and we have developed a system for that and neeloysaha he is going to explain to you about the different functionalities of the system howit works how it has been built what are the different challenges and so onand ah thereafter we are going to go through a simulation which will ah ah an animationsorry an animation which will which will show you how iot healthcare solutions can be deployedin order to give better healthcare to the different citizens of a countryhi i am neeloy saha a research scholar under doctor sudip misra and i will discuss aboutthe different facets of the ambusens system the ambusens project mainly aims at addressingthe shortcomings of the existing healthcare infrastructure in our country with a particularfocus on ambulatory healthcare using the communication and the sensing technologies of the internetof things one of the main problems of the existing healthcaresystem is that it is more of a manual operating system that is it requires the physical presenceof the patient at the health care centers so using the variable sensing technologiesand the wireless sensors which are often small in size and variable using the ambusens projectwe attempt to bring the healthcare closer to the patientsanother problem that is existing in the traditional healthcare is and that is especially pronouncein the case of ambulatory healthcare is that of emergency response type often times themedical personnel or the technicians who accompany the patients in the ambulance are not wellequipped to deal with any complications that may arise that is because they do not havethe technical expertise to deal with such complications using the ambusens projectsand its instant real time monitoring capabilities ah we have the provision for remote feedbackand monitoring by the skilled personnels at some remote place and this significantly canhelp in dealing with such complicated complication and such problems that may arise during transitin an ambulance ah another problem that often arises is thatof real time monitoring for example let us consider a case in which ah a patient is transferredusing an ambulance from a primary or secondary care hospitals in some town or rural areato a specialized clinic in the city so while the patient is actually going from the townto the city in the ambulance the condition of the patient is not monitored at all thismay lead to some problems such as the patient condition may degrade over time and when thepatient actually reaches the destination hospital the doctors they are may not be ah equippedto deal with that condition so using the real time monitoring we can orthe ambusens system we can track the dynamic changes of the patients condition over timeand this can significantly reduce the latency of the medical care ah the existing systemtraditional healthcare also requires each patient to carry his or her own medical recordswith him whenever he visits the healthcare facilities but these physical records arevulnerable to physical laws wear and tear so the ambusens project also incorporatesa cloud based digital record keeping system to deal with these kind of challengesthe ambusens project incorporates different iot based sensing technologies and is capableof monitoring different health parameters some of the parameters monitored are heartrate electrocardiogram temperature galvanic skin response etcetera the exact parameterswhich are monitored depend are often dependent upon upon the particular application scenariofor example if we consider the case of a patient having some cardiac disease the electrocardiogramor ecg will be of primary importance also in a pediatric case the temperature of anplays a vital role the sensing layer of the ambusens project consists of different wirelesssensors which sample the physiological data coming from the patient and using internetof things communication technologies such as bluetooth zigbee among others the datais sent to a local herb or a local data processing unit where the data is aggregated and sentfurther for processing now the challenges that we faced in the aggregationlayer include power management data rate tuning and noise data rate tuning is a challengebecause it is often times related to power management for example and also data fidelityfor example when dealing with electrocardiogram or ecg data we found that ah minimum samplingrate of one zero two four herds what was needed to preserve the fidelity of the ecg data noiseis a important parameter that must be taken into account at the sensing layer especiallynever scenario where we are dealing with the mobility of a patient often times due to themovement and the ah jerking of the ambulance the thinners that we are receiving corruptedin the presence of noise so we implemented different kinds of filteringalgorithms in the local data processing unit to obtain a clean noise free signal the ambusensproject also leverages the power of cloud computing for storage and analytics but herethe challenge is that we are dealing with medical data which is often of a sensitivenature for a privacy stand point the cloud computing and storage is often vulnerableto compromise of a patients identity so here we have developed a health card frameworkwhich is totally privacy aware the ambusens system incorporates a novel identity maskingmodule which suppresses the part of a patients identity ah before sending it to the cloudso that cloud computation and analytics can be carried out on a incomplete data set clearby preserving the patients identity as is evident from this figure ah as we increasethe number of clients the mean delay remains constant thus leading credence to the scalabilityof the system the ambusens project also incorporates a web based interface for doctors and paramedicsfor ah using the different functionalities of the system functionalities may includefeatures ah such as we have developed ah provisions for recording the medical data ah we havedeveloped a feedback system so that doctors can give their feedback and their skills skilledexpertise to the paramedics who were travelling in the ambulance also it includes advanceddata visualization graphing tools for better understanding of the data it also helps inah sporting patterns and trends in the real life data streams that are comingnow as i have already explained the different modules of the ambusens system work togetherto achieve real time monitoring here first we have the wireless body area networks whichare formed by parallel sensing devices which capture the medical data the health parametersah which indicate the condition of the patient and using communication technologies suchas bluetooth and zigbee the data is sent to a local data processing unit where it is aggregatedand filtering algorithms and techniques may be used and further using communication technologycellular technology such as lt or wireless land technologies such as i triply eight zerotwo point eleven we forward the data to a server hospital serverwhich contains a identity masking unit which suppresses the part of the patients identityas discussed and the raw data is now anonymous and before it is sent to the cloud the datain the cloud apart from being anonymous with respect to a patients identity also is storedin different ah virtual machines which are unique for each hospital thus extending theisolation between the data and preserving the privacy further the data is stored inthe cloud and analytics may also be carried out and on demand that process held data issent to a second server at the hospital where we have the reverse identity masking unitidentity management unit which helps in getting back the original data set complete data setand from there the paramedics the doctors and all the caregivers who are authorizedto access the data can view the data through the web interface in graphical format foranalysis and prognosis now we come to an implementation and demonstrationof the ambusens system unfortunately due to privacy concerns we cannot actually show youthe use of the ambusens system on a real patient instead we will prevent an animation ah whichshows the use of at the ambusens system into different scenarios part one details the useof the system in a static hospital scenario and it also includes a brief description ofthe sensors part two includes the use of the ambusens system in a typical ambulatory carescenario sohere we consider a typical scenario in which the developed iot based healthcare systemnamely ambusens maybe used here we consider a patient lying on the hospital bed with anurse or paramedic attending him or her let us consider a situation when the patient needsto be monitored in real time by doctor who is at some remote place now this situationmay arise due to a couple of reasons a this situation may be a rural hospital but thereis a lack of specialized doctors capable upliftment particular affliction which is aiming thepatient it may also be the case that with a doctor who is regularly attending to thepatient maybe on leave and some emergency regarding the status of the patient may requireremote monitoring to enable remote monitoring you may use theambusens system as follows the nurse or paramedic who is attending to the patient is requiredto place the wireless sensor divisors to the patient body as shown the wireless sensorsused can be of many heterogeneous types and are application specific depending on thetypes of physiological parameters that we may want to monitor for example here in theambusens system we have the provision for measuring the pulse rate the electrocardiogramor ecg and also the temperature of the patient for the sake of probity here we display onlytwo types of sensors the heart rate and a ecg sensors the heart rate sensor he may useis spaced on the of gram or epg this principle hinges light emitting diodes to illuminatethe skin each cardiac cycle there is a difference in the pressure of blood flow so the arteriesin the tissue or skin which leads to a difference in light absorption these inturn is encodedand can be used to calculate the heart rate of the patienthere we also measure electrocardiogram or ecg of the patient now electrocardiogram recordsthat electrical activity generated by heart muscle depolarization which propagately pulserating electrical waves versus although the amount of electricity is in fact very smallit is in micromoles it can be picked up quite reliably with ecg electrodes attached to theskin as shown in the diagram these heterogeneous sensors together make up a sensing layer orthe iot architecture the sensor nodes treated on the patients bodyat equipped to the bluetooth transceiver unit which is used to send the sends data to alocal hub for data acquisition and preliminary process here we have used a laptop or a localhub so preliminary processing includes calibration of the data in proper format for further processingand filtering to remove access noise generated calibration includes algorithms to convertepg reading obtained from the heart rate sensor intellectual heart rate readings etceterathe local hub that is the laptop is capable of receiving the data through bluetooth andthen it transmits the data using either wireless lan wifi or cellular technologies such asthree g or lte to the ambusens servers all of this is done while the sensors areactive and data sensing is going on to achieve real time data aggregation and processinglocal hub performs part of the activities of the aggregation and processing layer ofthe iot architecture at that remote end the doctor is capable of accessing the real timedata by logging in to the ambusens servers and the wave interface at ambusens dot dotac dot in using authorized credentials and using the data visualization tools which areavailable on the website he or she is able to get a graphical representation of the realtime data captured from the patient here we consider another scenario which isparticularly well suited for the application of the ambusens system that of mobile ambulatoryhealth monitoring let us consider the case of a patient we transported by an ambulanceto another far away healthcare facility this situation is quite common especially in thecase of a rural or some urban hospitals where the patient which quite often referred toa specialized inside the ambulance we see the patient lying on his paramedic accompanyhim or her typically in this scenarios the patients health condition while in transitis not monitored by doctors at either end the doctors and inform about the status ofthe patient when we first commences his journey but while in transit the patient conditionmay have change the significantly thus doctors are be prepared to give the best possiblecare to the patient this is where the ambulance system comes into the picture as we had seenin the hospital scenario the paramedic attaches the wireless sensor devises to the patientbody the wireless of the sensor devises make them easily variable and makes his easy forthe patient to be moved to and from the ambulance the sensor communicate with the local hubusing bluetooth technology a local hub in his cares has been replaced and abled androiddevice the rationally behind is to provide mobility support about a ubiquitous connectivitythe mobile nature of the environment introduces more noise into the system whose require robustnoise filtering mechanisms to make the stringent reliability constraint in post by medicaldata this part is also handled by the local hub thus the local hub provides functionalitiescommon to both are aggregation then the processing layer of the iot architecture while the ambulanceis in transit real time sensor data is tooled using the lte connection to the ambusen serverthe doctors in the both hence that if at the referee end the refer can login to the ambusenswebsite that is ambusens dot iot k g p dot ac dot in and access there is data in realtime to monitor the status of the patient into probable real time feedback to the paramedicthus we present the ambusen system as use case of iot in healthcare where we use thedifferent aspects of a internet of things such as wireless sensors heterogeneous communicationtechnologies to solve some of the challenges present in modern healthcare to conclude weencourage the viewers to think about what particular challenges the mobility can introduceinto this system and how we may go invoke solving themthe two scenarios of deployment shown in the animation ah that systems were tried out inthose two scenarios figure one shows the trials in the hospital scenario and figure two showsthe trials in the ambulatory scenario both trails were carried out successfully and througha number of iterations we have successfully calibrated and ah tested out the system theresults are shown in the next slide the figure on the left ah is that of a ecg tracing froma traditional wired ecg system and on the right you can see the real time trace generatedfrom the ambusens system comparison within the two traces shows the validity of the systemthus in conclusion iot based technologies the sensing and the communication technologiesof the internet of things may be used to enhance the existing healthcare system in our countryand i hope that this example inspires you to develop ah iot based healthcare systemson your own thank you for listening
